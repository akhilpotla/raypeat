Estrogen and brain aging in men and women: Depression, energy, stress</b><br></font> 




<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman" style="line-height:1.5em;">




<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
the incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is 2 or 3 times as high among women 
as among men, there is a major campaign under way to convince the public 
that taking estrogen supplements will prevent the disease.  Estrogen 
is now mainly promoted to prevent osteoporosis (another problem that 
is more common in women) and heart disease (which is more common in 
men).  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">This 
substance, which came into medical use as &quot;the female hormone&quot; 
for the treatment of &quot;female problems,&quot; especially for improving 
fertility, and then for preventing fertility as the oral contraceptive, 
is now being aimed primarily at the post-reproductive population, for 
problems that are essentially unrelated to femininity.  It is, 
in fact, being presented to the public as something to prevent major 
age-related conditions.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Brain 
degeneration, like osteoporosis, takes years to develop.  Analysis 
of letters written by young women, for example, showed limited mental 
functioning in those who many years later developed Alzheimer&#39;s disease, 
and young women who have small bones are the ones most likely to develop 
osteoporosis later.<b>  It seems clear that the course of degenerative 
aging processes is set in young adulthood (or even earlier), and that 
it is never too early to be concerned with correcting processes that 
are going in the wrong direction.</b>  (See Walker, et al., 1988, 
and Smith, et al., 1992.) </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
&quot;The Biological Generality of Progesterone&quot; (1979) I proposed 
that the life-long trajectory of energy production and longevity was 
strongly influenced by prenatal nutrition and progesterone.  This 
idea was based on work by people such as Marion Diamond, who showed 
that prenatal progesterone enlarges the cortex of the brain, and that 
estrogen makes it smaller, and Leonell Strong, who showed that a treatment 
that lowered the estrogen function in a young mouse could produce cancer-free 
offspring for several generations.  Strong&#39;s work was very encouraging, 
because it showed that biological problems that had been &quot;bred 
in&quot; over many generations could be corrected by some simple metabolic 
treatments.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Seeing 
these profoundly toxic long-range effects of estrogen, which shaped 
the animal&#39;s growth, development, function, and even its heredity, made 
it important to learn how estrogen works, because such fundamental changes 
covering the whole range of biology, produced by a simple little molecule, 
promised to reveal interesting things about the nature of life.</font> <br>

</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Aging 
is an energy problem, and in the brain, which has extremely high energy 
requirements, interference with the energy supply quickly causes cells 
to die.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">I 
believe that estrogen&#39;s &quot;principle,&quot; in all of its actions, 
is to interfere with the respiratory mode of energy production.  
This is an integrating principle that explains estrogen&#39;s immediate, 
direct effects on cells and organisms, which aren&#39;t explained by the 
idea that it acts on the genes through a specific &quot;estrogen receptor.&quot;  
(It&#39;s hard to imagine, for example, how the &quot;estrogen receptor&quot; 

doctrine could explain the fact that a single injection of estrogen 
can kill a large portion of brain cells.)  It explains why estrogen 
causes cells to take up water, allowing calcium to enter, activating 
various enzymes and cell division.  On the organismic level, it 
explains why estrogen mimics &quot;shock,&quot; releasing histamine 
and activating the nervous and glandular stress response system.  
The inefficiency of metabolism which doesn&#39;t use oxygen in the normal 
way causes glucose to be used rapidly, and this in itself is enough 
to trigger the release of pituitary ACTH and adrenal cortisol.  
The ACTH, and related hormones, liberate free fatty acids, which cells 
take up instead of glucose, and this (in the so-called Randall cycle) 
further limits the body&#39;s ability to oxidize glucose.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">People 
have spoken of &quot;cascades&quot; in relation to the adrenal glucocorticoids 
(e.g., cortisol) and estrogen, leading to cell damage, but really both 
of these hormonal cascades have to be seen as part of a more general 
collapse of adaptive systems, as a result of both chronic and immediate 
inadequacies of energy production.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Estrogen 
activates the adrenal stress reaction by way of the hypothalamus and 
pituitary, by direct actions on the adrenal glands, and by a variety 
of indirect effects, such as the increase of free fatty acids.  
It activates the excitotoxic glutamic acid pathway, and interferes with 
protective adenosine inhibition of nerves.  It has both direct 
and indirect ways of promoting the formation of nitric oxide and carbon 
monoxide.  These, and other estrogen-promoted factors, quickly 
and seriously interfere with mitochondrial respiration.  Many of 
these effects contribute to increased intracellular calcium and free 
radical production, contributing to both the excitatory excess and the 
energy deficit.</b></font> <br></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
biochemical details of these cascades are mainly interesting because 
they show how many different kinds of stress converge on a few physiological 
processess--mitochondrial energy production, cellular excitation, and 
intercellular communication--which, when damaged thousands of times, 
lead to the familiar states of old age.  These few functions, damaged 
by an infinite variety of stresses, have their own complexly adaptive 
ways of deteriorating, producing the various degenerative diseases.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">This 
perspective brings dementia, heart failure, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency 
and other diseases of aging together, in ways that allow generalized 
therapeutic and preventive approaches.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
antistress, antiestrogen approaches become fundamental to prevention 
of aging.  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
pro-estrogenic nature of the unsaturated fatty acids is probably the 
biggest barrier to the radical elimination of degenerative diseases.  
Various saturated fatty acids, including butyric, octanoic, and palmitic, 
have protective effects on mitochondrial respiration.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Progesterone 
is the basic brain-protective antiestrogen.  It works to protect 
the brain at many levels (preventing lipid peroxidation, exitotoxicity, 
nitric oxide damage, energy deficit, edema, etc.) and it promotes repair 
and recovery.</b> </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Progesterone 
in most cases has effects opposite to estrogen&#39;s, improving mitochondrial 
energy production while preventing excessive excitation.  Along 
with pregnenolone, progesterone is recognized as a neurosteroid with 
anti-excitotoxic actions, with the ability to promote repair and regeneration 
of the nervous system. (Roof, Stein, Faden; Schumacher, et al.; Baulieu.) </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
use of aspirin, which reduces inflammation and inhibits the formation 
of neurotoxic prostaglandins, is known to be associated with a lower 
incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and in other contexts, it offers protection 
against estrogen.  Naloxone, the antiendorphin, has been found 
to reverse some of the cumulative effects of stress, restoring some 
pituitary and ovarian function, and it promotes recovery after brain 
injury<b>;</b> in a variety of ways, it corrects some of estrogen&#39;s 
toxic effects. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Adenosine 
helps to maintain brain glycogen stores, which are lost in stress and 
aging.  Vitamin B12 protects against nitric oxide, and improves 
alertness.  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Pyruvic 
acid has brain-protective effects, apparently through its decarboxylation 
(producing carbon dioxide) rather than through its use as an energy 
source, since other ketoacids are similarly protective.  (The ketoacids 
occur in some natural foods.) The directly brain-protective effect of 
carbon dioxide offers many clues that should be interpreted in relation 
to estrogen&#39;s toxicity, since many of their effects on nerves are opposite.  <b>
Estrogen blocks the production of energy while it stimulates nerve cells 
to use energy more rapidly, and carbon dioxide promotes the production 
of energy, while restraining the excitation which expends energy.   </b>

The presence of carbon dioxide is an indicator of proper mitochondrial 
respiratory functioning.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Pharmaceutical 
blockers of glutamic acid transmission, and of calcium and sodium uptake, 
prevent some deterioration following brain injury, but the most physiological 
way to protect against those toxic processes is to maintain metabolic 
energy at a high level.  Magnesium, which is protective against 
excitatory damage and is a calcium antagonist, tends to be retained 
in proportion to the activity of thyroid hormone.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">As 
I have discussed previously, progesterone alone has brought people out 
of post-epileptic dementia and senile dementia, but it is reasonable 
to use a combined physiological approach, including thyroid.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Besides 
providing new insights into biological energy and aging, the recognition 
that estrogen activates the stress hormone system--the pituitary-adrenal 
system--also provides clear insights into other problems, such as the 
polycystic ovary syndrome, hirsutism, adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing&#39;s 
disease, etc.</font> <br></p>

Stress, Glucocorticoids, and Damage to the Nervous System: The Current 
State of Confusion.</b> Sapolsky RM Department of Biological Sciences, 
Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305. <b>An extensive literature 
demonstrates that glucocorticoids (GCs), the adrenal steroids secreted 
during stress, can have a broad range of deleterious effects in the 
brain. The actions occur predominately, but not exclusively, in the 
hippocampus, a structure rich in corticosteroid receptors and particularly 
sensitive to GCs. The first half of this review considers three types 
of GC effects: a) GC-induced atrophy, in which a few weeks&#39; exposure 
to high GC concentrations or to stress causes reversible atrophy of 
dendritic processes in the hippocampus; b) GC neurotoxicity where, over 
the course of months, GC exposure kills hippocampal neurons; c) GC neuroendangerment, 
in which elevated GC concentrations at the time of a neurological insult 
such as a stroke or seizure impairs the ability of neurons to survive 
the insult. The second half considers the rather confusing literature 
as to the possible mechanisms underlying</b> these deleterious GC actions. 
Five broad themes are discerned: a) that GCs induce a metabolic vulnerability 
in neurons due to inhibition of glucose uptake; b) that GCs exacerbate 
various steps in a<b> damaging cascade of glutamate excess, calcium 
mobilization and oxygen radical generation. In a review a number of 
years ago, I concluded that these two components accounted for the deleterious 
GC effects. Specifically, the energetic vulnerability induced by GCs 
left neurons metabolically compromised, and less able to carry out the 
costly task of containing glutamate, calcium and oxygen radicals. More 
recent work has shown this conclusion to be simplistic, and GC actions 
are shown to probably involve at least three additional components: 
c) that GCs impair a variety of neuronal defenses against neurologic 
insults; d) that GCs disrupt the mobilization of neurotrophins; e) that 
GCs have a variety of electrophysiological effects which can damage 
neurons. </b>The relevance of each of those mechanisms to GC-induced 
atrophy, neurotoxicity and neuroendangerment is considered, as are the 
likely interactions among them. </font></p>

men.</b> Kirschbaum C, Schommer N, Federenko I, Gaab J, Neumann O, Oellers 
M, Rohleder N, Untiedt A, Hanker J, Pirke KM, Hellhammer DH Center for 
Psychobiological, University of Trier, Germany. <b> Evidence from animal 
studies and clinical observations suggest that the activity of the pituitary-adrenal 
axis is under significant influence of sex steroids. The present study 
investigated how a short term elevation of estradiol levels affects 
ACTH, cortisol, norepinephrine, and heart rate responses to mental stress 
in healthy men. </b>In a double blind study, 16 men received a patch 
delivering 0.1 mg estradiol/day transdermally, and age- and body mass 
index-matched control subjects received a placebo patch. Twenty-four 
to 48 h later, they were exposed to a brief psychosocial stressor (free 
speech and mental arithmetic in front of an audience). In response to 
the psychosocial stressor, ACTH, cortisol, norepinephrine, and heart 
rate were increased in both experimental groups (all P &lt; 0.0001). 
However, the<b> estradiol-treated subjects showed exaggerated peak ACTH 
(P &lt; 0.001) and cortisol (P &lt; 0.002) responses compared to the 
placebo group. Also, the norepinephrine area under the response curve 
was greater in the estradiol group </b>
(P &lt; 0.05). Although heart rate responses differences failed to reach 
statistical significance, they, too, tended to be larger in the estradiol 
group. Neither mood ratings before or after the stressor, nor ratings 
of the perception of the stressor could explain the observed endocrine 
response differences. In conclusion, <b>short term estradiol administration

to psychosocial stress in healthy young men independent of psychological 
effects, </b>as assessed in this study.   </font></p>

a loss of the glucocorticoid receptor&#39;s ability to autoregulate; this 
suggests that E may cause a functional impairment of the glucocorticoid

Effects of sex hormones on the steroidogenic activity of dispersed adrenocortical 
cells of the rat adrenal cortex.</b> Nowak KW, Neri G, Nussdorfer GG, 
Malendowicz LK  &quot;The effect of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone 
on glucocorticoid secretion were studied in vitro by using dispersed 
inner adrenocortical cells obtained from gonadectomized female and male 
rats. Independently of the sex of animals, estradiol enhanced basal, 
but not ACTH-stimulated corticosterone (B) secretion; conversely, testosterone 
inhibited ACTH-stimulated, but not basal B output.&quot; &quot;Testosterone 
inhibited by about 30% ACTH-stimulated PREG production and by about 
54% total post-PREG secretion (B was decreased to 56% of the control 
value, and other steroid hormones were below the limit of sensitivity 
of our assay system). These findings indicate that sex hormones directly 
affect rat adrenocortical secretion,<b> mainly by acting on the rate-limiting 
step of steroidogenesis (i.e. the conversion of cholesterol to PREG);

The influence of ovarian steroids on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal

(ACTH) and corticosterone (B) was assessed in intact female rats as 
a function of oestrous cycle stage under resting conditions and after 
exposure to a 20 min restraint stress. To delineate the roles of oestradiol 
and progesterone in HPA axis modulation, plasma concentrations of ACTH 
and B were determined in ovariectomised (OVX) animals treated with oestradiol 
and/or progesterone under resting conditions and during exposure to 
the stress of a novel environment. The effects of these steroid treatments 
on the transcription and/or binding properties of the two corticosteroid 
receptors, the mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors, 
were also examined in hippocampal tissue, (i) Fluctuations in basal 
and<b> stress-induced plasma ACTH and B concentrations were found during 
the oestrous cycle with highest levels at late pro-oestrus. (ii) In

presumably renders the opioid target cells supersensitive to either 
residual beta-endorphin or other endogenous mu ligands, such as met-enkephalin, 
thus resulting in chronic opioid <b>suppression of the pattern of LHRH

Can J Physiol Pharmacol, 1992, 70 Suppl:, S138-44.  Brain glycogen 
is localized almost exclusively to glia, where it undergoes continuous 
utilization and resynthesis. We have shown that glycogen utilization 
increases during tactile stimulation of the rat face and vibrissae.<b>  
Conversely, decreased neuronal activity during hibernation and anesthesia 
is accompanied by a marked increase in brain glycogen content</b>. These 
observations support a link between neuronal activity and glial glycogen 
metabolism. The energetics of glycogen metabolism suggest that glial 
glycogen is mobilized to meet increased metabolic demands of glia rather 
than to serve as a substrate for neuronal activity. An advantage to 
the use of glycogen may be the potentially faster generation of ATP 
from glycogen than from glucose. Alternatively, glycogen could be utilized 
if glucose supply is transiently insufficient during the onset of increased 
metabolic activity. Brain glycogen may have a <b>dynamic role as a buffer 
between the abrupt increases in focal metabolic demands that occur during 
normal brain activity and the compensatory changes in focal cerebral 
blood flow or oxidative metabolism.</b> </font></p>

associated network with neurons. They respond to neuronal activity and 
synaptically released glutamate by raising intracellular calcium concentration 
([Ca2+]i), which could represent the start of back-signalling to neurons.<b> 

Here we show that coactivation of the AMPA/kainate and metabotropic 
glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on astrocytes stimulates these cells to 
release glutamate through a Ca2+-dependent process mediated by prostaglandins. 
Pharmacological inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis prevents glutamate 
release, whereas application of prostaglandins (in particular PGE2) 
mimics and occludes the releasing action of GluR agonists. PGE2 promotes 
Ca2+-dependent glutamate release from cultured astrocytes and also from 
acute brain slices under conditions that suppress neuronal exocytotic 
release. </b>When applied to the CA1 hippocampal region, PGE2 induces 
increases in [Ca2+]i both in astrocytes and in neurons. The [Ca2+]i 
increase in neurons is mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes, 
because it is abolished by GluR antagonists.<b> Our results reveal a

from arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase pathway), and nitric

Prostanoids and nitric oxide have a number of common targets, on which

&quot;Although chronic inflammatory reactions have been proposed to

the role of prostaglandins (PGs), one of the secretory products of inflammatory

initial observation that <b>PGE1-induced differentiated neuroblastoma

an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, has led us to postulate 
that PGs act as a neurotoxin.</b> This study has further investigated 
the effects of PGs on differentiated NB cells in culture. Results showed 
that PGA1 was more effective than PGE1 in causing degeneration of differentiated 
NB cells as shown by the cytoplasmic vacuolation and fragmentation of 
soma, nuclei, and neurites. Because increased levels of ubiquitin and 
beta-amyloid have been implicated in causing neuronal degeneration, 
we studied the effects of PGs on the levels of these proteins during 
degeneration of NB cells in vitro....&quot; &quot;Results showed that 
PGs increased the intracellular levels of ubiquitin and beta-amyloid 
prior to degeneration, whereas the degenerated NB cells had negligible 
levels of these proteins. <b>These data suggest that PGs act as external

disease.</b> Prasad KN, Hovland AR, La Rosa FG, Hovland PG<b>. </b>
 &quot;Chronic inflammatory reactions in the brain appear to be one 
of the primary etiological factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#39;s 
disease (AD). This is supported by the fact that the secretory products 
of inflammatory reactions, which include cytokines, complement proteins, 
adhesion molecules, and free radicals, are neurotoxic. We have recently 
reported that prostaglandins (PGs), which are also released during inflammatory 
reactions, cause rapid degenerative changes in differentiated murine 
neuroblastoma cells (NB) in culture.&quot; &quot;The mechanisms underlying 
Abeta-induced neuronal degeneration have been under intense investigation, 
and several mechanisms of action have been proposed. We postulate that 
PG-induced elevation of Abeta may lead to an increased binding of Abeta 
to the 20S proteasome, resulting in a reduction of 20S proteasome-mediated 
degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. This is predicted to lead 
to an increase in an accumulation of abnormal proteins, which ultimately 
contribute to neuronal degeneration and death.  Based on our hypothesis 
and on studies published by others, we propose that a combination of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit the synthesis of 
PGs, and antioxidant vitamins, which quench free radicals and both of 
which have been recently reported to be of some value in AD treatment 
when used-individually, may be much more effective in the prevention 
and treatment of AD than the individual agents alone.&quot; </font></p>

synaptology by estrogen.</b> Leedom L; Lewis C; Garcia-Segura LM; Naftolin 
F.  Ann N Y Acad Sci, 1994 Nov 14, 743:, 61-71  &quot;Estrogen 
modulates the synaptology of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus during 
sexual differentiation of the rat brain in both males and females. In <b>
males, testosterone of gonadal origin is converted to estrogen in the 
brain</b> by an enzyme, aromatase, which is also present in females. 
The exposure of the male&#39;s hypothalamus to relatively high levels of 
estrogen (following a perinatal testosterone surge) leads to the development 
of a pattern of synaptogenesis<b> which does not support an estrogen-induced 
gonadotrophin surge in the adult.</b>  In female rats, hypothalamic 
development <b>occurs with permissively low levels</b> of estrogen, 
enabling a midcycle estrogen-induced gonadotrophin surge and ovulation 
in adulthood. During adult reproductive life in female rats, circulating 
estrogen modulates the synaptology of the arcuate nucleus. <b>The most 
physiological example of this is the 30-50% loss of axosomatic synapses 
following the preovulatory estrogen surge on diestrus-proestrus.</b> 

Studies on post-synaptic membranes of the arcuate nucleus reveal sex 
differences in membrane organization and protein content which are estrogen-dependent.  <b>
Estrogen apparently stimulates endocytosis of areas of post-synaptic 
membrane that are dense with small intramembranous protein particles, 
resulting in a reduction in the number of small intramembranous particles. 
This also appears to be the physiologic mechanism of neuronal changes 
in females during the estrus cycle.</b> Repeated exposure to preovulatory 
levels of estrogen may lead to an age-related decline in reproductive 
capacity in female rats.  Aging females lose the estrogen-induced 
gonadotrophin surge responsible for ovulation. <b>This loss of function 
may result from a cumulative estrogen effect during the repeated ovarian 
cycles which results in a reorganization of the synaptology</b> on which 
regulates the estrogen-induced gonadotrophin surge.&quot;  &quot;. 
. .recent research has shown that GABA, the monoamines, and several 
neuropeptides are participants in the estrogen-sensitive network which 
regulates GNRH secretion. In this regard, present work shows estrogen-induced 
changes in GABA and dopamine synapses in the arcuate nucleus.&quot;</font></p>
