Tissue-bound estrogen in aging</b><br></font> 


<i><p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The "Estrogen 
Replacement" industry is based on the doctrine that a woman's tissues 
are depleted of estrogen after menopause. This doctrine is false.</font></p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The concentration 
of a hormone in the blood doesn't directly represent the concentration 
in the various organs.</font></p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The amount 
of estrogen in tissue is decreased when progesterone is abundant. In 
the absence of progesterone, tissues retain estrogen even when there 
is little estrogen circulating in the blood.</font></p>

<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Many things 
suggest an increased estrogenic activity at menopause. For example, 
melatonin decreases sharply at puberty when estrogen increases, and 
then it decreases again at menopause. 
Prolactin (stimulated by estrogen) increases around puberty, and instead 
of decreasing at menopause, it often increases, and its increase is 
associated with osteoporosis and other age-related symptoms. </font></p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen 
is produced in many tissues by the enzyme 
aromatase, even in the breast and endometrium, although these are considered 
"target tissues" rather than endocrine glands. 
Aromatase increases with aging.</font></p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen 
is inactivated, mainly in the liver and brain, by being made water soluble 
by the attachment of glucuronic acid and/or sulfuric acid. </font></p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen's 
concentration in a particular tissue depends on many things, including 
its affinity or binding strength for components of that tissue, relative 
to its affinity for the blood; the activity in that tissue of the 
aromatase enzyme, which converts androgens to estrogen; the activity 
of the glucuronidase enzyme, that converts water-soluble estrogen 
glucuronides into the oil soluble active forms of estrogen; and the 
sulfatases and several other enzymes that modify the activity and solubility 
of the estrogens.</font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"> 
The "estrogen receptors," proteins which bind 
estrogens in cells, are inactivated by progesterone, and activated by 
many physical and chemical conditions.</font></p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Inflammation 
activates beta-glucuronidase, and antiinflammatory substances such as 
aspirin reduce many of estrogen's effects. </font></p></i>

<hr size=1 width=75%>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Doctrines 
are admitted into the &quot;scientific canon&quot; by those who have 
the power of censorship. In astronomy, Halton Arp's discovery of &quot;anomalous&quot; 

galactic red-shifts is practically unknown, because the journal editors 
say the observations are &quot;just anomalies,&quot; or that the theories 
which could explain them are unconventional; but the actual problem 
is that they are strong evidence against The Big Bang, Hubble's Law, 
and the Expanding Universe. American science, since the 1940s, has probably 
been the most censored and doctrinaire in the world. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Gilbert 
Ling's revolution in cell biology remains outside the canon, despite 
the profound influence of MRI, which grew directly out of his view of 
the cell, because his work provided conclusive evidence that cells are 
not regulated by &quot;semipermeable membranes and membrane pumps.&quot; 
Every field of science is ruled by a doctrinaire establishment. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Charles 
E. Brown-Séquard (1817-94) was a physiologist who pioneered scientific 
endocrinology, but who was ridiculed because of his claim that extracts 
of animal glands had an invigorating effect when injected. His place 
in the scientific canon is mainly as an object of ridicule, and the 
details of his case are perfectly representative of the way our “canon” 
has been constructed. The argument for dismissing his observations was 
that he used a water extract of testicles, and, according to the 20th 
century American biologists, testosterone is not water soluble, and 
so the water extract would have “contained no hormone.” The argument 
is foolish, because living organs contain innumerable substances that 
will solublize oily molecules, but also because Brown-Sequard was describing 
an effect that wasn’t necessarily limited to a single chemical substance. 
(The transplanting of living cells to repair tissues is finally being 
accepted, but the pioneers in promoting tissue regeneration or repair 
with the transplantation of living, dead, or stressed cells--V. Filatov, 
L.V. Polezhaev, W.T. Summerlin, for example--were simply written out 
of history.)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">If 
Brown-Séquard’s extract couldn’t work because testosterone isn’t 
soluble in water, then what are we to think of the thousands of medical 
publications that talk about “free hormones” as the only active 
hormones? (“Free hormone” is defined as the hormone that isn’t 
bound to a transporting protein, with the more or less explicit idea 
that it is dissolved in the water of the plasma or extracellular fluid.) 
Brown-Séquard’s tissue extracts would have contained solublizing 
substances including proteins and phospholipids, so the oily hormones 
would certainly be present (and active) in his extracts. But the thousands 
of people who ridiculed him committed themselves to the fact that steroid 
hormones are insoluble in water. By their own standard, they are selling 
an impossibility when they do calculations to reveal the amount of “free 
hormone,” as something distinct from the protein bound hormone, in 
the patient’s blood.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
immense Hormone Replacement Therapy </font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">industry--which 
Brown-Séquard’s experiments foreshadowed--is based on the fact that 
the concentrations of some hormones in the blood serum decrease with 
aging.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">At 
first, it was assumed that the amount of the hormone in the blood corresponded 
to the effectiveness of that hormone. Whatever was in the blood was 
being delivered to the “target tissues.” But as the idea of measuring 
“protein bound iodine” (PBI) to determine thyroid function came 
into disrepute (because it never had a scientific basis at all), new 
ideas of measuring “active hormones” came into the marketplace, 
and currently the doctrine is that the “bound” hormones are inactive, 
and the active hormones are “free.” The “free” hormones are 
supposed to be the only ones that can get into the cells to deliver 
their signals, but the problem is that “free hormones” exist only 
in the imagination of people who interpret certain lab tests, as I discussed 
in the newsletter on thyroid tests (May, 2000).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
the 1960s and 1970s, when the PBI test was disappearing, there was intense 
interest in--a kind of mania regarding--the role of “membranes” 
in regulating cell functions, and the membrane was still seen by most 
biologists as the “semipermeable membrane” which, “obviously,” 
would exclude molecules as large as albumin and the other proteins that 
carry thyroid and other hormones in the blood. (In reality, and experimental 
observations, albumin and other proteins enter cells more or less freely, 
depending on prevailing conditions.) The membrane doctrine led directly 
to the “free hormone” doctrine. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">This 
issue, of arguing about which form of a hormone is the “active” 
form, has to do with explaining how much of the blood-carried hormone 
is going to get into the “target tissues.” If the membrane is a 
“semipermeable” barrier to molecules such as hormones, then specific 
receptors and transporters will be needed. If the concentration of a 
hormone inside the cell is higher than that in the blood, a “pump” 
will usually be invoked, to produce an “active transport” of the 
hormone against its concentration gradient.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>But 
if the membrane regulates the passage of hormones from blood to tissue 
cells, and especially if pumps are needed to move the hormone into the 
cell, how relevant is the measurement of hormones in the blood?</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Within 
the blood, progesterone and thyroid hormone (T3) are much more concentrated 
in the red blood cells than in the serum. Since it isn’t likely that 
red blood cells are “targets” for the sex hormones, or for progesterone 
or even thyroid, their concentration “against their gradient” in 
these cells suggests that a simple distribution by solubility is involved. 
Oily substances just naturally tend to concentrate inside cells because 
of their insolubility in the watery environment of the plasma and extracellular 
fluid. Proteins that have “oily” regions effectively bind oily molecules, 
such as fats and steroids. Even red blood cells have such proteins.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
the case of oil soluble molecules, such as progesterone and estrogen, 
it’s important to explain that most of their “binding” to proteins 
or other oil-loving molecules is really the nearly passive consequence 
of the molecules’ being forced away from the watery phase--they are 
hydrophobic, and although it would take a great amount of energy to 
make these insoluble substances enter the watery phase, the attractive 
force between them and the cell is usually small. This means that they 
can be freely mobile, while “bound” or concentrated within the cell. 
The oxygen atoms, and especially the phenolic group of estrogen, slightly 
reduce the hormones’ affinity for simple oils, but they interact with 
other polar or aromatic groups, giving estrogen the ability to bind 
more strongly and specifically with some proteins and other molecules. 
Enzymes which catalyze estrogen’s oxidation-reduction actions are 
among the specific estrogen-binding proteins.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Many 
proteins and lipoproteins bind steroids, but some intracellular proteins 
bind them so strongly that they have </font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">been--in 
a very teleological, if not anthropomorphic, way--considered as the 
switch by which the hormone turns on the cellular response. In the popular 
doctrine of the Estrogen Receptor, a few molecules of estrogen bind 
to the receptors, which carry them to the nucleus of the cell, where 
the activated receptors turn on the genes in charge of the female response. 
(Or the male response, or the growth response, or the atrophy response, 
or whatever genetic response estrogen is producing.) Once the switch 
has been thrown, the estrogen molecules have fulfilled their hormonal 
duty, and must get lost, so that the response isn’t perpetuated indefinitely 
by a few molecules.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
the Estrogen Receptor doctrine is worse than silly, there are real proteins 
which bind estrogen, and some of these are called receptors. The uterus, 
breast, and brain, which are very responsive to estrogen, bind, or concentrate, 
estrogen molecules.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">When 
I was working on my dissertation, I tried to extract estrogens from 
hamster uteri, but the chemical techniques I was using to measure estrogen 
weren’t accurate for such small quantities. A few years later, S. 
Batra was able to extract the estrogen from human tissue in quantities 
large enough for accurate analysis by radioimmunoassay. (Batra, 1976.)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">His 
crucial observation was that the difference in estrogen concentration 
between tissue and blood was lowest in the luteal phase, when progesterone 
is high: </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>“The 
tissue/plasma ratio of E2 [estradiol] ranged from</b> <b>1.45 to 20.36 
with very high values in early follicular phase and the lowest in 
mid-luteal phase.”</b> This means that progesterone prevents the tissue 
from concentrating estrogen. He made similar observations during pregnancy, <b>

with tissue estrogen decreasing as blood progesterone increased, so 
that</b> <b>there is less estrogen in the tissue than in the plasma.</b> 
But in women who aren’t pregnant, and when their progesterone is low, 
the tissues may contain 20 to 30 times more estrogen than the plasma 
(in equal volumes).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
aging, the sharply decreased progesterone production creates a situation 
resembling the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, allowing tissues 
to concentrate estrogen even when the serum estrogen may be low.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">“</font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>In 
postmenopausal women, the tissue concentration of E2 was not significantly 
lower than in menstruating women in follicular phase. . . .</b>” (Akerlund, 
et al., 1981.)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Besides 
the relatively direct actions of progesterone on the estrogen receptors, 
keeping their concentration low, and its indirect action by preventing 
prolactin from stimulating the formation of estrogen receptors, there 
are many other processes that can increase or decrease the tissue concentration 
of estrogen, and many of these influences change with aging.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">There 
are two kinds of enzyme that produce estrogen. Aromatase converts male 
hormones into estrogen. Beta-glucuronidase converts the inactive estrogen-glucuronides 
into active estrogen. The healthy liver inactivates practically all 
the estrogen that reaches it, mostly by combining it with the “sugar 
acid,” glucuronic acid. This makes the estrogen water soluble, and 
it is quickly eliminated in the urine. But when it passes through inflamed 
tissue, these tissues contain large amounts of beta-glucuronidase, which 
will remove the glucuronic acid, leaving the pure estrogen to accumulate 
in the tissue.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Many 
kinds of liver impairment decrease its ability to excrete estrogen, 
and estrogen contributes to a variety of liver diseases. The work of 
the Biskinds in the 1940s showed that a dietary protein deficiency prevented 
the liver from detoxifying estrogen. Hypothyroidism prevents the liver 
from attaching glucuronic acid to estrogen, and so increases the body’s 
retention of estrogen, which in turn impairs the thyroid gland’s ability 
to secrete thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism often results from nutritional 
protein deficiency.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
we commonly think of the ovaries as the main source of estrogen, the 
enzyme which makes it can be found in all parts of the body. Surprisingly, 
in rhesus monkeys, aromatase in the arms accounts for a very large part 
of estrogen production. Fat and the skin are major sources of estrogen, 
especially in older people. <b>The activity of 
aromatase increases with aging, and under the influence of 
prolactin, cortisol, prostaglandin, and the pituitary hormones, 
FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and growth hormone.</b> <b>It is 
inhibited by progesterone, thyroid, aspirin, and high altitude.</b> 
Aromatase can produce estrogen in fat cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle 
cells, breast and uterine tissue, pancreas, liver, brain, bone, skin, 
etc. Its action in breast cancer, endometriosis, uterine cancer, lupus, 
gynecomastia, and many other diseases is especially important. Aromatase 
in mammary tissue appears to increase estrogen receptors and cause breast </font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">neoplasia, independently of ovarian 
estrogen (Tekmal, et al., 1999).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Women 
who have had their ovaries removed are usually told that they need to 
take estrogen, but animal experiments consistently show that removal 
of the gonads causes the tissue aromatases to increase. The loss of 
progesterone and ovarian androgens is probably responsible for this 
generalized increase in the formation of estrogen. In the brain, aromatase 
increases under the influence of estrogen treatment.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Sulfatase 
is another enzyme that releases estrogen in tissues, and its activity 
is inhibited by antiestrogenic hormones. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
at least some tissues, progesterone inhibits the release or activation 
of beta-glucuronidase (which, according to Cristofalo and Kabakjian, 
1975, increases with aging). Glucaric acid, which inhibits this enzyme, 
is being used to treat breast cancer, and glucuronic acid also tends 
to inhibit the intracellular release of estrogen by beta-glucuronidase.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
there is clearly a trend toward the rational use of antiestrogenic treatments 
for breast cancer, in other diseases the myth of estrogen deficiency 
still prevents even rudimentary approaches.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Ever 
since Lipshutz’ work in the 1940s, it has been established that the <b><i>
uninterrupted</i></b> effect of a little estrogen is more harmful than 
larger but intermittent exposures. But after menopause, when progesterone 
stops its cyclic displacement of estrogen from the tissues, the tissues 
retain large amounts of estrogen continuously.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
menopause itself is produced by the prolonged exposure to estrogen beginning 
in puberty, in spite of the monthly protection of the progesterone produced 
by cycling ovaries. The unopposed action of the high concentration of 
tissue-bound estrogen after menopause must be even more harmful.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
decline of the antiestrogenic factors in aging, combined with the increase 
of pro-estrogenic factors such as cortisol and prolactin and FSH, occurs 
in both men and women. During the reproductive years, women’s cyclic 
production of large amounts of progesterone probably retards their aging 
enough to account for their greater longevity. </font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Childbearing 
also has a residual antiestrogenic effect and is associated with increased 
longevity.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Being 
aware of this pervasive increase in estrogen exposure with aging should 
make it possible to marshal a comprehensive set of methods for opposing 
that trend toward degeneration.</font> <br></p>

engenders a compensatory increment in mu opioid binding in the medial

results in a cascade of neuroendocrine deficits that are ultimately 
expressed as a chronically attenuated plasma LH pattern to which the

of exposure time to large doses of estrogens provided a reliable model 
for early changes in reproductive aging.” “Premature occurrence 
of vaginal opening was observed in all three estrogenized groups independently 
of EB exposure. However, females bearing implants for 24 h had first 
estrus at the same age as their controls and cycled regularly, and neither 
histological nor gonadal alterations could be observed at 75 days. Interestingly, 
they failed to cycle regularly at 5 mo whereas controls continued to 
cycle.” “On the other hand, the increase of EB exposure (Ei5, EI) 
resulted in a gradual and significant delay in the onset of first estrus 
and in a high number of estrous phases, as frequently observed during 
reproductive decline. At 75 days, the ovaries of these last two groups 
showed a reduced number of corpora lutea and <b>an increased number 
of large follicles</b>. According to this histological pattern, ovarian 
weight and progesterone (P) content gradually decreased whereas both 
groups showed higher estradiol (E-2) content than controls. This resulted 
in <b>a higher E-2:P ratio, comparable to that observed in normal aging 
rats.</b> <b>The results allow us to conclude that the exposure time 
to large doses of  estrogens is critical to the gradual enhancement 
of reproductive decline. Furthermore, exposures as brief as 24 h led 
to a potential early model for aging studies that will be useful to 
verify whether neuroendocrine  changes precede 
gonadal impairment.”</b></font> <br></p>

Aromatase overexpression and breast

mouse model and demonstrated for the first time that increased mammary 
estrogens resulting from the overexpression of aromatase in mammary 
glands lead to the induction of various preneoplastic and neoplastic 
changes that are similar to early breast cancer.” “Our current studies 
show aromatase overexpression is sufficient to induce and maintain early 
preneoplastic and neoplastic changes in female mice without circulating 
ovarian estrogen. Preneoplastic and neoplastic changes induced in mammary 
glands as a result of aromatase overexpression can be completely abrogated 
with the administration of the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole. Consistent 
with complete reduction in hyperplasia,<b> we have also seen 
downregulation of estrogen receptor and a decrease in cell proliferation</b> 
markers, suggesting aromatase-induced hyperplasia can be treated with

Therefore the endogenous levels and the subcellular distribution of

consent. Striking differences were seen between the breast and uterine 
tissues for the total tissue concentration of estradiol, the ratio between

the androgens, the tissue/plasma gradient was higher for DHEA than for

The highly significant correlation between the androgens suggests an 
intracellular metabolism of DHEAS to DHEA and 5-Adiol. <b>Lower concentrations
