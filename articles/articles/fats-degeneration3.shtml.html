======<WBR>==============================<WBR>====</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>50 
years ago, in the first phase of marketing the polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (PUFA), linoleic acid was “heart protective,” and the saturated 
fats raised cholesterol and caused heart disease.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>In 
the second phase, the other “essential fatty acid,” linolenic acid, 
was said to be even better than linoleic acid.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>In 
the third phase, the longer chain omega -3 (omega minus three, or n 
minus three) fatty acids, DHA and EPA, are said to be even better than 
linolenic acid.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Along 
the way, the highly unsaturated arachidonic acid, which we and other 
animals make out of the linoleic acid in foods, was coming to be identified 
with the “harmful animal fats.” But we just didn&#39;t hear much about 
how the amount of arachidonic acid in the tissues depended on the amount 
of linoleic acid in the diet.</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>U.S. 
marketing dominates the world economy, including of course the communication 
media, so we shouldn&#39;t expect to hear much about the role of PUFA in 
causing cancer, diabetes, obesity, aging, thrombosis, arthritis and 
immunodeficiency, or to hear about the benefits of the saturated fats. </b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>The 
saturated fats include the “tropical fats,” because they are synthesized 
in very warm organisms, and are very stable at those temperatures. Their 
stability offers some protection against the unstable PUFA. </b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Several 
of the degenerative conditions produced by the “essential fatty acids” 
can be reversed by use of saturated fats, varying in length from the 
short chains of coconut oil to the very long chains of waxes.</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p>                        <font size="2" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">======<WBR>==============================<WBR>=====</font> <br>

</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">When 
a person uses a drug, there is generally an awareness that the benefit 
has to be weighed against the side effects. But if something is treated 
as a “nutrient,” especially an “essential nutrient,” there is 
an implication that it won&#39;t produce undesirable side effects.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Over 
the last thirty years I have asked several prominent oil researchers 
what the evidence is that there is such a thing as an “essential fatty 
acid.” One professor cited a single publication about a solitary sick 
person who recovered from some sickness after being given some unsaturated 
fat. (If he had known of any better evidence, wouldn&#39;t he have mentioned 
it?) The others (if they answered at all) cited “Burr and Burr, 1929</font><font size="2" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">.” </font><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The</font><font size="2" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> </font><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">surprising 
thing about that answer is that these people can consider any nutritional 
research from 1929 to be definitive. It&#39;s very much like quoting a 1929 
opinion of a physicist regarding the procedure for making a hydrogen 
bomb. What was known about nutrition in 1929? Most of the B vitamins 
weren&#39;t even suspected, and it had been only two or three years since 
“vitamin B” had been subdivided into two factors, the “antineuritic 
factor,” B<sub>1</sub>, and the “growth factor,” B<sub>2</sub>. 
Burr had no way of really understanding what deficiencies or toxicities 
were present in his experimental diet.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">A 
few years after the first experiments, Burr put one of his “essential 
fatty acid deficient” rats under a bell jar to measure its metabolic 
rate, and found that the deficient animals were metabolizing 50% faster 
than rats that were given linoleic and linolenic acids as part of their 
diet. That was an important observation, but Burr didn&#39;t understand 
its implications. Later, many experiments showed that the polyunsaturated 
fats slowed metabolism by profoundly interfering with the function of 
the thyroid hormone and the cellular respiratory apparatus. Without 
the toxic fats, respiratory energy metabolism was very intense, and 
a diet that was nutritionally sufficient for a sluggish animal wouldn&#39;t 
necessarily be adequate for the vigorous animals.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Several 
publications between 1936 and 1944 made it very clear that Burr&#39;s basic 
animal diet was deficient in various nutrients, especially vitamin B<sub>6</sub>. <b>
The disease that appeared in Burr&#39;s animals could be cured by fat free 
B-vitamin preparations, or by purified vitamin B6 when it became available.</b> <b>
A zinc deficiency produces similar symptoms, </b>

and at the time Burr did his experiments, there was no information on 
the effects of fats on mineral absorption.  If a diet is barely 
adequate in the essential minerals, increasing the metabolic rate, or 
decreasing intestinal absorption of minerals, will produce mineral deficiencies 
and metabolic problems.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
“Burr&#39;s disease” clearly turned out to be a B-vitamin deficiency, 
probably combined with a mineral  deficiency, it continues to be 
cited as the basis justifying the multibillion dollar industry that 
has grown up around the “essential” oils.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Two 
years before Burr&#39;s experiment, German researchers found that a fat-free 
diet prevented almost all spontaneous cancers in rats. Later work showed 
that the polyunsaturated fats both initiate and promote cancer. With 
that knowledge, the people who kept claiming that “linoleic, linolenic, 
and maybe arachidonic acid are the essential fatty acids,” should 
have devoted some effort to finding out how much of that “essential 
nutrient” was enough, so that people could minimize their consumption 
of the carcinogenic stuff. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Between 
the first and second world wars, cod liver oil was recommended as a 
vitamin supplement, at first as a source of vitamin A, and later as 
a source of vitamins A and D. But in the late 1940s, experimenters used 
it as the main fat in dogs&#39; diet, and found that they all died from 
cancer, while the dogs on a standard diet had only a 5% cancer mortality. 
That sort of information, and the availability of synthetic vitamins, 
led to the decreased use of cod liver oil.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">But 
around that time, the seed oil industry was in crisis because the use 
of those oils in paints and plastics was being displaced by new compounds 
made from petroleum. The industry needed new markets, and discovered 
ways to convince the public that seed oils were better than animal fats. 
They were called the “heart protective oils,” though human studies 
soon showed the same results that the animal studies had, namely, that 
they were toxic to the heart and increased the incidence of cancer. </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
“lipid hypothesis” of heart disease argued that cholesterol in the 
blood caused atherosclerosis, and that the polyunsaturated oils lowered 
the amount of cholesterol in the blood. Leaving behind the concept of 
nutritional essentiality, this allowed the industry (and their academic 
supporters, such as Frederick Stare at Harvard) to begin promoting the 
oils as having drug-like therapeutic properties. Larger amounts of polyunsaturated 
fat were supposed to be more protective by lowering the cholesterol, 
and were to be substituted for the saturated fats, which supposedly 
raised cholesterol and increased heart disease, producing atherosclerotic 
plaques in the blood vessels and increasing the formation of blood clots.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Since 
all ordinary foods contain significant amounts of the polyunsaturated 
fats, there was no reason to think that, even if they were essential 
nutrients, people were likely to become deficient in them. So the idea 
of treating the seed oils as drug-like substances, to be taken in large 
amounts, appealed to the food oil industry.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Prostaglandins, 
which are produced in the body by oxidizing the polyunsaturated fatty 
acids, provided an opportunity for the drug industry to get involved 
in a new market, and<b> the prostaglandins offered a new way of arguing 
for the nutritional essentiality of linoleic and related acids: A whole 
system of “hormones” is made from these molecules.</b> Since some 
of the prostaglandins suppress immunity, cause inflammation and promote 
cancer growth, some people have divided them into the “good prostaglandins” 
and the “bad prostaglandins.” </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">PGI2, 
or prostacyclin, is considered to be a good prostaglandin, because it 
causes vasodilatation, and so drug companies have made their own synthetic 
equivalents:</font><font size="2" face="Courier New"> </font><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Epoprostenol, 
iloprost, taprostene, ciprostene, UT-15, beraprost, and cicaprost. Some 
of these are being investigated for possible use in killing cancer. </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">But 
many very useful drugs that already existed, including cortisol and 
aspirin, were found to achieve some of their most important effects 
by inhibiting the formation of the prostaglandins. It was the body&#39;s 
load of polyunsaturated fats which made it very susceptible to inflammation, 
stress, trauma, infection, radiation, hormone imbalance, and other fundamental 
problems, and drugs like aspirin and cortisone, which limit the activation 
of the stored “essential fatty acids,” gain their remarkable range 
of beneficial effects partly by the restraint they impose on those stored 
toxins.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Increasingly, 
the liberation of arachidonic acid from tissues during stress is seen 
as a central factor in all forms of stress, either acute (as in burns 
or exercise) or chronic (as in diabetes or aging). And, as the fat stores 
become more toxic, it seems that they more readily liberate the free 
fatty acids. (For example, see Iritani, et al., 1984)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">During 
this same period, a few experimenters were finding that animals which 
were fed a diet lacking the “essential” fatty acids had some remarkable 
properties<b>:</b> They consumed oxygen and calories at a very high 
rate, their mitochondria were unusually tough and stable, their tissues 
could be transplanted into other animals without provoking immunological 
rejection, and they were very hard to kill by trauma and a wide variety 
of toxins that easily provoke lethal shock in animals on the usual diet. 
As the Germans had seen in 1927, they had a low susceptibility to cancer, 
and new studies were showing that they weren&#39;t susceptible to various 
fibrotic conditions, including alcoholic liver cirrhosis.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
1967 a major nutrition publication, <i>Present Knowledge in Nutrition,</i> 

published Hartroft and Porta&#39;s observation that the “age pigment,” 
lipofuscin, was formed in proportion to the amount of polyunsaturated 
fat and oxidants in the diet. The new interest in organ transplantation 
led to the discovery that the polyunsaturated fats prolonged graft survival, 
by suppressing the immune system. Immunosuppression was considered to 
have a role in the carcinogenicity of the “essential” fatty acids. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Around 
the same time, there were studies that showed that unsaturated fats 
retarded brain development and produced obesity.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Substances 
very much like the prostaglandins, called isoprostanes and neuroprostanes, 
are formed spontaneously from highly unsaturated fatty acids, and are 
useful as indicators of the rate of lipid peroxidation in the body. 
Most of the products of lipid peroxidation are toxic, as a result of 
their reactions with proteins, DNA, and the mitochondria. The age-related 
glycation products that are usually blamed on sugar, are largely the 
result of peroxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Through 
the 1970s, this sort of information about the harmful effects of the 
PUFA was being slowly assimilated by the culture, though many dietitians 
still spoke of “the essential fatty acids, vitamin F.” By 1980, 
it looked as though responsible researchers would see the promotion 
of cancer, heart disease, mitochondrial damage, hypothyroidism and immunosuppression 
caused by the polyunsaturated fats as their most important feature, 
and would see that there had never been a basis for believing that they 
were essential nutrients.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">But 
then, without acknowledging that there had been a problem with the doctrine 
of essentiality, fat researchers just started changing the subject, 
shifting the public discourse to safer, more profitable topics. The 
fats that had been called essential, but that had so many toxic effects, 
were no longer emphasized, and the failed idea of “essentiality” 
was shifted to different categories of polyunsaturated fats. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
addition of the long chain highly unsaturated fats to baby food formulas 
was recently approved, on the basis of their supposed “essentiality 
for brain development.” One of the newer arguments for the essentiality 
of the PUFA is that “they are needed for making cell membranes.” 
But human cells can grow and divide in artificial culture solutions 
which contain none of the polyunsaturated fats, and no one has claimed 
that they are growing “without membranes.” </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
long chain fats found in fish and some algae don&#39;t interfere with animal 
enzymes as strongly as the seed oils do, and so by comparison, they 
aren&#39;t so harmful. They are also so unstable that relatively little 
of them is stored in the tissues. (And when they are used as food additives, 
it&#39;s necessary to use antioxidants to keep them from becoming smelly 
and acutely toxic.)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">When 
meat is grilled at a high temperature, the normally spaced double bonds 
in PUFA migrate towards each other, becoming more stable, so that linoleic 
acid is turned into “conjugated linoleic acid.” This analog of the 
“essential” linoleic acid competes against the linoleic acid in 
tissues, and protects against cancer, atherosclerosis, inflammation 
and other effects of the normal PUFA. Presumably, anything which interferes 
with the essential fatty acids is protective, when the organism contains 
dangerous amounts of PUFA. Even the trans-isomers of the unsaturated 
fatty acids (found in butterfat, and convertible into conjugated linoleic 
acid) can be protective against cancer.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
the 1980s the oil promoters were becoming more sophisticated, and were 
publishing many experiments in which the fish oils were compared with 
corn oil, or safflower, or soy oil, and in many of those experiments, 
the animals&#39; health was better when they didn&#39;t eat the very toxic seed 
oils, that contained the “essential fatty acids,” linoleic and linoleic 
acids. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Besides 
comparing the fish oils to the stronger toxins, another trick is to 
take advantage of the same immunosuppressive property that had seemed 
troublesome, and to emphasize their ability to temporarily alleviate 
some autoimmune or allergic diseases. X-rays were once used that way, 
to treat arthritis and ringworm, for example.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">And, 
knowing that cancer cells have the ability to consume large amounts 
of fatty acids, they would test these fats in tissue culture dishes, 
and demonstrate that they were poisonous, cytotoxic, to the fast growing 
cancer cells. Although they caused cancer in animals, if they could 
be shown to kill cancer cells in a dish, they could be sold as anticancer 
drugs/nutrients, with the special mystique of being “essential fatty 
acids.” Strangely, their ability to kill cancer cells under some circumstances 
and to suppress some immunological reactions is being promoted in close 
association with the doctrine that these fats are nutritionally essential.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Arachidonic 
acid is made from linoleic acid, and so those two oils were considered 
as roughly equivalent in their ability to meet our nutritional needs, 
but a large part of current research is devoted to showing the details 
of how fish oils protect against arachidonic acid. The “balance” 
between the omega -3 and the omega -6 fatty acids is increasingly being 
presented as a defense against the toxic omega -6 fats. But the accumulation 
of unsaturated fats with aging makes any defense increasingly difficult, 
and the extreme instability of the highly unsaturated omega -3 fats 
creates additional problems.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">PUFA 
and x-rays have many biological effects in common. They are immunosuppressive, 
but they produce their own inflammatory reactions, starting with increased 
permeability of capillaries, disturbed coagulation and proteolysis, 
and producing fibrosis and tumefaction or tissue atrophy. This isn&#39;t 
just a coincidence, since ionizing radiation attacks the highly unstable 
polyunsaturated molecules, simply accelerating processes that ordinarily 
happen more slowly as a result of stress and aging.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Prolonged 
stress eventually tends to be a self-sustaining process, impairing the 
efficient respiratory production of energy, converting muscle tissue 
to amino acids, suppressing the thyroid, and activating further mobilization 
of fatty acids. Fatty acids are mobilized from within the structure 
of cells by phospholipases, and from fat tissues by other lipases. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
highly unsaturated fatty acids, as well as the ordinary “essential 
fatty acids,” act directly to increase capillary permeability, even 
without conversion into prostaglandins, and they interfere in many ways 
with the clotting and clot removal systems. The effects of PUFA taken 
in a meal probably disturb the clotting system more than the same quantity 
of saturated fat, contrary to many of the older publications. The PUFA 
are widely believed to prevent clotting, but when cod liver oil is given 
to “EFA deficient” animals, it activates the formation of clots 
(Hornstra, et al., 1989). An opposite effect is seen when a long chain 
fatty acid synergizes with aspirin, to restrain clotting (Molina, et 
al., 2003).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Fibrosis 
is a generalized consequence of the abnormal capillary permeability 
produced by things that disrupt the clotting system. Estrogen, with 
its known contribution to the formation of blood clots and edema and 
fibrosis and tumors, achieves part of its effect by maintaining a chronically 
high level of free fatty acids, preferentially liberating arachidonic 
acid, rather than saturated fatty acids.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Butter, 
beef fat, and lamb fat are the only mostly saturated fats produced on 
a large scale in the U.S., and the cheapness/profitability of the seed 
oils made it easy to displace them. But, in the face of the immense 
amount of propagandistic “health” claims that have been made against 
the saturated fats, it&#39;s instructive to look at some of their actual 
effects, especially on the clotting system, and the related fibrotic 
reactions.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
saturated fatty acids are very unreactive chemically. Coconut oil, despite 
containing about 1% of the unstable PUFA, can be left in a bucket at 
room temperature for a year or more without showing any evidence of 
deterioration, suggesting that the predominance of saturated fat acts 
as an antioxidant for the unsaturated molecules. In the body, the saturated 
fats seem to act the same way, preventing or even reversing many of 
the conditions caused by oxidation of fats. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
stress-induced liberation of arachidonic acid causes blood vessels to 
leak, and this allows fibrin to escape from the blood stream, into the 
basement membrane and beyond into the extracellular matrix, where it 
produces fibrosis. (Cancer, autoimmune diseases, and heart disease involve 
the same inflammatory, thrombotic, fibrotic processes as the nominal 
fibroses.) Scleroderma, liver cirrhosis, fibrosis of the lungs, heart, 
and other organs, and all the diseases in which fibrous tissue becomes 
dense and progressively contracts, involve similar processes, and the 
treatments which are successful are those that stop the inflammation 
produced by the oxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Retroperitoneal 
fibrosis is now known to be produced by estrogen, and is treated by 
antiestrogenic and antiserotonergic drugs, but as early as 1940 Alejandro 
Lipschutz demonstrated that chronic exposure to very low doses of estrogen 
produced fibromas in essentially every part of the body. Earlier, Loeb 
had studied the action of large doses of estrogen, which produced fibrosis 
of the uterus, as if it had accelerated aging. Following Lipschutz&#39; 
work, in which he demonstrated the “antifibromatogenic” actions 
of pregnenolone and progesterone, several Argentine researchers showed 
that progesterone prevented and cured abdominal adhesions and other 
fibrotic conditions, including retroperitoneal fibrosis.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Since 
estrogen produces both leakiness of the capillaries and excessive formation 
of fibrin, its effects will be seen first in the organs where it concentrates, 
but eventually anywhere capillaries leak fibrin. Estrogen activates 
the phospholipase which liberates arachidonic acid, and progesterone 
inhibits that phospholipase. </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">As 
the fat tissues become more burdened with arachidonic acid, they release 
it more easily in response to moderately lipolytic stress signals. This 
could explain the increased levels of free fatty acids and lipid peroxidation 
that occur with aging. In animals that are “deficient” in the polyunsaturated 
fatty acids, adrenalin doesn&#39;t have the lipolytic effect that it does 
in animals on the standard diet. With aging, there is not only a tendency 
to have chronically higher free fatty acids in the blood, but for those 
fatty acids to be more unsaturated. The phospholipids of mitochondria 
and microsomes become more unsaturated with aging (Laganiere and Yu, 
1993, Lee, et al., 1999). In the human retina there is a similar accumulation 
of PUFA with aging (Nourooz-Zadeh and Pereira, 1999), which implies 
that the aged retina will be more easily damaged by light. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Several 
studies suggest that a high degree of unsaturation in the fats is fundamentally 
related to the aging process, since long lived species have a lower 
degree of unsaturation in their fats. Caloric restriction decreases 
the age-related accumulation of the fatty acids with 4 and 5 double 
bonds.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
publicity has emphasized the anti-inflammatory effects of fish oil, 
experiments show that it is extremely effective in producing alcohol-related 
liver cirrhosis. Breakdown products of polyunsaturated fats (isoprostanes 
and 4-HNE) are found in the blood of people with alcoholic liver disease 
(Aleynik, et al., 1998). In the absence of polyunsaturated fats, alcohol 
doesn&#39;t produce cirrhosis. Saturated fats allow the fibrosis to regress<b>:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>“A

lipid and protein oxidation and oxygen radical generation, the double

chronic feeding with semi-purified AIN-93G diets rich in highly unsaturated

higher double bond content and lipid peroxidation than SAT mitochondria. 
They also showed increased levels of the markers of protein oxidative 
damage malondialdehyde-lysine, protein carbonyls, and N(e)-(carboxymethyl)lysine

of fatty acid unsaturation of heart mitochondria increases oxidative 
damage to their lipids and proteins, and can also increase their rates 
of mitochondrial oxygen radical generation in situations in which the 
degree of reduction of Complex III is higher than normal. These observations

the estimation of fibrinolytic activity is proposed. In this method, 
a fibrin clot suspension is used as a substrate (fibrin is known to 
be a physiological substrate of plasmin). The fibrin clot suspension 
was prepared by homogenization of human fibrin clots. With this method, 
we found that free fatty<b> acids inhibited the plasmin activity, and 
long-chain, unsaturated free fatty acids had a particularly strong inhibitory 
action on plasmin. As regards the mechanism of the inhibitory action, 
free fatty acids may not inhibit complex formation between plasmin and 
fibirin, but may make it impossible for plasmin to act on fibrin due 
to deformation of the surface of the fibrin clot.</b></font> <br>
