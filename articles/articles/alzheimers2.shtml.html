&quot;Increase of cytoplasmic free calcium may therefore be called 'the

background of diseases is also characterized by an increase of intracellular 
calcium.  Diseases typically associated with aging include hypertension, 
arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and dementia.&quot;</i></font> <br>
</p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="2" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><i>T. 
Fujita, &quot;Calcium, parathyroids and aging,&quot; in Calcium-Regulating 
Hormones. 1. Role in Disease and Aging, H. Morii, editor, Contrib. Nephrol. 
Basel, Karger, 1991, vol. 90, pp. 206-211.  </i></font> <br>

</p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify"><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>THE FUNCTION 
OF ENERGY</b></font> <br></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Most 
people are slightly demented now and then, when they are very sleepy 
or tired, or sick, or drunk, or having a hormone imbalance or extreme 
anxiety state.  Sometimes physicians have described people as demented, 
implying that the condition would never improve, when the person was 
depressed or hypothyroid.  If the person has a history of epilepsy, 
or is very old, the physician is more likely to diagnose dementia than 
if the same loss of mental function occurs in a younger person without 
a history of a nervous disorder.  Even people with less education 
are at increased risk of being diagnosed as &quot;demented.&quot; </font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
1976, I saw a 52 year-old woman who had the diagnosis of epileptic dementia.  
After 3 or 4 days of taking progesterone, her mental function returned 
to the extent that she could find her way around town by herself, and 
could work.  A few months later, she returned to graduate school, 
got straight As and a master's degree.  A few years later, a man 
in his 80s showed the classical signs of senile dementia, with childishness, 
confusion, self-centeredness, and unstable emotions.  A few days 
after getting a mixture of thyroid, pregnenolone, and progesterone, 
his mind was again clear, and he was able to work on a research project 
he had set aside years before.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">When 
the body temperature is very much below normal, mental functioning is 
seriously limited.  I think the first question that should be asked 
about a demented person is &quot;is this the cold brain syndrome, or 
is something else involved?&quot; When it is known that the brain has 
shrunken drastically, and filled up with plaques and developed gliosis, 
we know that something more than a &quot;cold brain&quot; is involved, 
but we don't know how much function could be regained if the hormones 
were normalized.  Every moment of malfunction probably leaves its 
structural mark.  Early or late, it is good to prevent the functional 
errors that lead to further damage, and to give the regenerative systems 
an opportunity to work.  Before the final &quot;calcium death&quot; 

described (above) by Fujita, there are many opportunities for intervening 
to stop or reverse the process.  The older the person is, the more 
emphasis should be put on protective inhibition, rather than immediately 
increasing energy production.  Magnesium, carbon dioxide, sleep, 
red light, and naloxone might be appropriate at the beginning of therapy.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
resting state of a cell is a highly energized state.  To the old 
Pavlovians, the resting state existed at two energy levels, and they 
applied the term &quot;protective inhibition&quot; generally to the 
depleted state (parabiosis) that occurs in exhaustion or coma, but I 
am using the phrase in a more general sense, that seems reasonable now 
that the concept of &quot;excitotoxic&quot; injury has become current.  
I mean it to include everything which protects against excitotoxic injury.  
This definition therefore has the virtue of being biochemically and 
physiologically very specific, while retaining the functional and therapeutic 
significance that it had for the Pavlovians.  (My book, <i>Mind 
and Tissue,</i> and the chapter &quot;A unifying principle&quot; in <i>

Generative Energy,</i> discussed the idea of the resting state and protective 
inhibition.)  </font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Ordinary 
healthy sleep is an example of restorative, protective inhibition.  
The energy charge, including levels of ATP, creatine phosphate, and 
glycogen storage, regulates many restorative enzyme systems.  I 
have suggested (1975, J. Orthomol. Psychiatry) how the entropy-sensitivity 
or cold-inactivation of an enzyme could be involved in shifting the 
brain toward a state of inhibition.  A recent publication (J. H. 
Benington and H. C. Heller, &quot;Restoration of brain energy metabolism 
as the function of sleep,&quot; Progress in Neurobiol. 45, 347-360, 
1995) has proposed that reduction of energy charge and depolarization 
of cells act through adenosine secretion to restore glycogen stores.  
Since glycogen stores decrease with aging, this work supports the idea 
that protective inhibition is weakened with aging.  (L. N. Simanovskiy 
and Zh. A. Chotoyev, &quot;The effect of hypoxia on glycogenolysis and 
glycolysis rates in the rat brain,&quot; Zhurnal Evolyutsionnoy Biokhimii 
i Fiziologii 6(5), 577-579, 1970.) </font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="2" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">J. 
H. Benington and H. C. Heller, &quot;Restoration of brain energy metabolism 
as the function of sleep,&quot; Prog. in Neurobiology 45, 347-360, 1995.  

&quot;...the conditions that have been demonstrated to stimulate adenosine 
release from neural tissue represent either increases in metabolic demand 
(...activation of excitatory receptors) or decreases in metabolic supply 
(hypoxia, ischaemia, hypoglycemia)....&quot;  &quot;In the brain, 
adenosine-stimulated increases in potassium conductance produce hyperpolarization, 
thereby reducing neuronal responsiveness....&quot;  &quot;Adenosine 
release is triggered globally in response to changes in cerebral energy 
homeostasis.&quot;  &quot;A number of findings provide indirect 
support for the hypothesis that glycogen stores are depleted during 
waking and restored during sleep.&quot;  &quot;Reduced availability 
of glycogen to astrocytes must...increase adenosine release....&quot;  
&quot;Because ATP concentration is 100-fold greater than AMP concentration, 
a minute decrease in cellular energy charge...is translated into a large 
proportional increase in extracellular adenosine cencentration....&quot;</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
terms &quot;functional quiescence&quot; and &quot;G0 quiescence&quot; 

are similar in meaning to the resting state; I think of cells in the 
state of &quot;G0 quiescence&quot; as being stem cells, waiting for 
use in regeneration, but I don't subscribe to the idea that they can't 
be reconstituted from functioning, differentiated cells.  In plants, 
dedifferentiation is achieved fairly easily, and in the study of animal 
cells the trend in that direction seems very obvious, though many people 
keep saying that it just isn't possible.  In general, the things 
such as lipid peroxidation or calcium influx which cause cell replication 
at one level, cause cell death at a higher level.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Energy 
to resist stress makes quiescence possible, and prevents the deterioration 
of cells, of the sort that occurs in aging.  O. Toussaint, et al., 
&quot;Cellular aging and energetic factors,&quot; Exp. Gerontology 30(1), 
1-22, 1995.  &quot;Experiments performed with endothelial cells 
in the context of the ischemia-reperfusion toxicity of free radicals, 
also offer good examples of the impact of cell energy on cell resistance 
to these toxic molecules.&quot;  &quot;...if a supplement of energy 
is given...the toxic effect of the free radicals is much reduced....&quot;</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
specific approaches of this orientation --to energize but quiet the 
brain--are diametrically opposed to some of the &quot;therapies&quot; 

for Alzheimer's disease that have been promoted recently by the drug 
industries:  Things to increase stimulation, especially to increase 
cholinergic excitation; even the excitotoxic amino acids themselves 
and their analogs; and estrogen, which is a multiple brain excitant, 
proconvulsant, excitotoxic promoter, and anti-memory agent.  Those 
product-centered publications stand out distinctly from the actual research.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">There 
are many energy-related vicious circles associated with aging, but the 
central one seems to be the fat-thyroid-estrogen-free<WBR>-radical-calcium 
sequence, in which the ability to produce stabilizing substances including 
carbon dioxide and progesterone is progressively lost, increasing susceptibility 
to the unstable unsaturated fats.</font> <br></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify"><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>EFFECTS OF ESTROGEN 
AND UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS</b> </font> <br></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen 
production is facilitated when tissue is cooler, and it lowers body 
temperature.  Estrogen and the endorphins act together in many 
ways (including the behavior of estrus), and naloxone (the antagonist 
of morphine and the endorphins) raises body temperature and in other 
ways opposes estrogen.  Naloxone has been found to improve the 
symptoms of demented people, and I have seen it quickly, and dramatically, 
improve the mental clarity of a 60 year old woman who had used estrogen.  
It, like clonidine (the anti-adrenaline drug), is a good candidate for 
controlling the hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
various degenerative brain conditions, blood clotting has been implicated 
either as a cause or a complication.  Many people are promoting 
unsaturated oils for their &quot;anti-clotting&quot; value, in spite 
of the older literature showing that they inhibit proteolytic enzymes 
and slow clot removal.  Several newer publications have revealed 
other aspects of their involvement in thrombus formation.  A. J. 
Honour, et al., &quot;The effects of changes in diet on lipid levels 
and platelet thrombus formation in living blood vessels,&quot; Br. J. 
Expt. Pathol. 59(4), 390-394, 1978--corn oil caused platelets to be 
more sensitive to ADP.</font></p></ul>

<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
there is a lot of talk about &quot;membrane fluidity,&quot; as a desirable 
thing, and the loss of unsaturated lipids in the aged brain, there are 
some interesting observations related to &quot;viscosity&quot; in Alzheimer's 
disease.  The platelets of Alzheimer's patients are less viscous, 
and lipids extracted from the brain are more fluid, and contain 30% 
less cholesterol than normal (on a molar basis, in relation to phospholipids).  
(G. S. Roth, et al., 1995.)  In general, lipid peroxidation causes 
cellular viscosity to increase, apparently by causing cross-linking 
of proteins, but I think the significance of the decreased cholesterol 
relates to its significance as precursor to pregnenolone and progesterone, 
and to the known association with Alzheimer's disease of a variant form 
of the cholesterol transporter protein, ApoE, which I suppose is a slightly 
less stable molecular form that is more susceptible to malfunction in 
stress.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
extracellular matrix is a major factor in the function and stability 
of brain cells. (L. F. Agnati, et al., &quot;The concept of trophic 
units in the central nervous system,&quot; Prog. in Neurobiol. 46, 561-574, 
1995.  Any factor producing edema tends to disrupt the extracellular 
matrix (Chan and Fishman, 1978, 1980, and L. Loeb, 1948.)</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Seizures 
are known to be promoted by estrogen, by unsaturated fats, and by lipid 
peroxidation, and to cause an increase in the size of the free fatty 
acid pool in the brain.  Prolonged seizures cause nerve damage 
in certain areas, especially the hippocampus, thalamus, and neocortex 
(Siesjo, et al., 1989).  Dementia is known to be produced by prolonged 
seizures.</font></p></ul>

<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Prenatal 
exposure to estrogen, to oxygen deficiency, or to unsaturated fats decreases 
the size of the brain at birth.  There is apparently a requirement 
for saturated fats during development (J. M. Bourre, N. Gozlan-Devillierre, 
O. Morand, and N. Baumann, &quot;Importance of exogenous saturated fatty 
acids during brain development and myelination in mice,&quot; Ann. Biol. 
Anim., Biochim., Biophys. 19(1B), 172-180, 1979.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Under 
the influence of estrogen, or unsaturated fats, brain cells swell, and 
their shape and interactions are altered.  Memory is impaired by 
an excess of estrogen.  Estrogen and unsaturated fat and excess 
iron kill cells by lipid peroxidation, and this process is promoted 
by oxygen deficiency.  The fetus and the very old have high levels 
of iron in the cells.  Estrogen increases iron uptake.  Estrogen 
treatment produces elevation of free fatty acids in the blood, and lipid 
peroxidation in tissues.  This tends to accelerate the accumulation 
of lipofuscin, age-pigment.  Lactic acid, the production of which 
is promoted by estrogen, lowers the availability of carbon dioxide, 
leading to impairment of blood supply to the brain.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen 
stimulates cell division, but can also increase the rate of cell death.  
Unsaturated fatty acids can also stimulate or kill.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Both 
estrogen and unsaturated fats promote the formation of age-pigment.  
Besides increasing the free fatty acid concentration, estrogen possibly 
depresses the level of cholesterol, both of which are changes seen in 
the senile brain.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen 
causes massive alterations of extracellular matrix, and seems to promote 
dissolution of microtubules (Nemetschek-Gannsler), as calcium does.  
Unsaturated fats increase calcium uptake by at least some brain cells 
(H. Katsuki and S. Okuda, 1995.)  Unsaturated fats, like estrogen, 
increase the permeability of blood vessels.  The unsaturated fat 
causes edema of the brain, inhibits choline uptake, blocking acetylcholine 
production.</font></p></ul>

<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Progesterone 
is a nerve growth factor, produced by glial cells (oligodendrocytes).  
It promotes the production of myelin, protects against seizures, and 
protects cells against free radicals.  It protects before conception, 
during gestation, during growth and puberty, and during aging.  
It promotes regeneration.  Its production is blocked by stress, 
lipid peroxidation, and an excess of estrogen and iron.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Aspirin 
protects against iron toxicity, clot formation, and reduces lipid peroxidation 
while blocking prostaglandin formation.  Aspirin and other antiinflammatory 
drugs, taken for arthritis, have been clearly associated with a reduced 
incidence of Alzheimer's disease.  Aspirin reduces the formation 
of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Unsaturated 
fatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids, are signals which activate 
cell systems.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Many 
different stimuli can induce cell activity, cell death, or change to 
another cell type.  (J. Niquet, et al., &quot;Glial reaction after 
seizure induced hippocampal lesion:  Immunohistochemical characterization 
of proliferating glial cells,&quot; J. Neurocytol. 23(10), 641-656, 
1994:  &quot;...hippocampal astrocytes from kainate-treated rats 
experess A2B5 immunoreactivity, a marker of type-2 astrocytes.&quot;  
&quot;This suggests that in the CNS, normal resident astrocytes acquire 
the phenotypic properties of type-2 astrocytes.&quot;)</font></p></ul>

<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">A 
&quot;deficiency&quot; of polyunsaturated fatty acids leads to altered 
rates of cellular regeneration and differentiation, a larger brain at 
birth, improved function of the immune system, decreased inflammation, 
decreased mortality from endotoxin poisoining, lower susceptibility 
to lipid peroxidation, increased basal metabolic rate and respiration, 
increased thyroid function, later puberty and decreases other signs 
of estrogen dominance.  When dietary PUFA are not available, the 
body produces a small amount of unsaturated fatty acid (Mead acids), 
but these do not activate cell systems in the same way that plant-derived 
PUFAs do, and they are the precursors for an entirely different group 
of prostaglandins.</font> <br></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify"><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>VITAMIN A AND 
THE STEROIDS</b></font> <br></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
a variety of cell types, vitamin A functions as an estrogen antagonist, 
inhibiting cell division and promoting or maintaining the functioning 
state.  It promotes protein synthesis, regulates lysosomes, and 
protects against lipid peroxidation.  Just as stress and estrogen-toxicity 
resemble aging, so does a vitamin A deficiency.  While its known 
functions are varied, I think the largest use of vitamin A is for the 
production of pregnenolone, progesterone, and the other youth-associated 
steroids.  One of vitamin E's important functions is protecting 
vitamin A from destructive oxidation.  Although little attention 
has been given to the effects of unsaturated fats on vitamin A, their 
destruction of vitamin E will necessarily lead to the destruction of 
vitamin A.  The increased lipid peroxidation of old age represents 
a vicious circle, in which the loss of the antioxidants and vitamin 
A leads to their further destruction.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">To 
produce pregnenolone, thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol have to be 
delivered to the mitochondria in the right proportion and sufficient 
quantity.  Normally, stress is balanced by increased synthesis 
of pregnenolone, which improves the ability to cope with stress.  
Lipid peroxidation, resulting from the accumulation of unsaturated fatty 
acids, iron, and energy deficiency, damages the mitochondrias' ability 
to produce pregnenolone.  When pregnenolone is inadequate, cortisol 
is over-produced.  When progesterone is deficient, estrogen's effect 
is largely unopposed.  When both thyroid and progesterone are deficient, 
even fat cells synthesize estrogen.</font> <br></p></ul>

<ul><p align="justify"><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>THE NATURE OF 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</b></font> <br></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
Alzheimer's disease until recently referred to a certain type of organic 
dementia occuring in people in their thirties, forties and fifties (presenile 
dementia), structural similarities seen in senile dementia have caused 
the term to lose its original meaning.  Alzheimer's sclerosis of 
blood vessels, and even the death of nerve cells, are sometimes neglected 
in favor of the more stylish ideas, emphasizing certain proteins that 
cause the tangles and plaques.  Until recently, the &quot;tangles&quot; 
were commonly interpreted as the debris left after the death of a cell, 
rather than as one of the processes causing the death of the cell.</font></p></ul>

is disrupted.  Transthyretin and Apo E accumulate unused, and deposit 
in blood vessels, around nerves, and in cytoplasm.  Pregnenolone

memory loss, destabilization of nerve cells, failure of myelin formation, 
and excess cortisol synthesis.  Free radicals and calcium cause 
multiple cell injuries including nerve-death.  Estrogen is released 
by elevated beta-glucuronidase.  Imbalances of other steroids, 
including cortisol and DHEA, develop as cells compensate for pregnenolone 
deficiency, causing shifts in balance of glial cells.  Hypothyroidism,

STRUCTURE AS A REGULATORY SYSTEM--AN EMERGING VISION OF PERVASIVE EPIGENESIS</b></font> <br>
</p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
the introduction I mentioned that membranous regulation and genetic 
determination should be considered as defunct theories.  What I 
have been saying about self-actualizing systems and the factors that 
disrupt them derives from a view of cell function that has been developing 
since the 1920s. </font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Around 
1940, a Russian biochemist (Oparin, I think) proposed that the enzymes 
of glycolysis were bound to the structure of the cell when they were 
not in use, and that they were &quot;desorbed&quot; under the conditions 
that required abundant glycolysis.  Knowing that concept, in 1970 
I proposed that the cell water itself underwent a transition under such 
conditions (which could include increased temperature, reduced oxygen, 
or nervous or hormonal stimulation).  Activation of glycolysis 
is usually explained by the availability of regulatory substances such 
as ammonia, phosphate, and NAD, and many biochemists were content to 
understand cells in terms of test-tube models.  But in the last 
few years, it has become clear that some of these basic regulatory molecules 
do bind to structural components of the cell.  (T. Henics, &quot;Thoughts 
over cell biology:  A commentary,&quot; Physiol. Chem. Phys. &amp; 

Med. NMR 27, 139-140, 1995.)  Although the details aren't clear, 
it is known that hormones and other factors stabilize or destabilize 
RNA, and that during some of these events relevant enzymes bind to the 
RNA.  When these facts are combined with the information that is 
accumulating on splicing and modification of RNA, and the copying of 
RNA back into DNA, the hereditary system is seen to be much more flexible 
than it was believed to be.  </font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">A 
global change of state is able to steer each part of the process, continuously.  
In this way, the cell resembles an analog, rather than a digital, control 
system:  each part is momentarily guided, rather than waiting for 
&quot;feedback.&quot;</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Where 
before, cellular &quot;regulatory mechanisms&quot; referred to certain 
feedback mechanisms based on interactions of randomly diffusing molecules, 
the new understanding of the cell sees a highly structured system in 
which very little is random, and the cell's adaptive possibilities, 
instead of being limited to a certain number of genetic switches, are 
shaped by every imaginable environmental influence.  The cell's 
structure, far from being &quot;read out of the genome,&quot; is sensitively 
reshaped constantly by processes that incorporate some of the environment 
in establishing each new stability.  The old-model-geneticists 
have been forced to admit that the genes can't specify everything in 
the organism's structure, and it was the brain's complexity that forced 
this recognition that certain things are developed &quot;epigenetically.&quot;  
But the new fact that most biologists are reluctant to accept is that 
the structure of the cell itself is developed very largely on the basis 
of information received from the environment--that is, &quot;epigenetically.&quot;</font></p></ul>

<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Traditionally, 
epigenesis has meant that the form of an embryo or organism didn't preexist, 
or wasn't completely specified by the genes.  That is, it has had 
to do with the relationships between cells.  It involved a recognition 
that &quot;cells are clever enough to design an organism.&quot;  
It is a significant step beyond that to the recognition that &quot;cells 
are clever enough to redesign themselves to meet situations never seen 
before.</font><font size="2" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">&quot;</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Biologists 
working with bacteria and yeasts have seen them adapt in non-random 
ways to novel conditions.  &quot;Directed mutations&quot; are impossible, 
according to the &quot;central dogma&quot; that has the support of textbooks 
and most biology professors, but they do occur in those single-celled 
organisms.  Barbara McClintock showed that in corn her mobile genes 
were mobilized by stress.  Although this isn't exactly &quot;directed 
mutation,&quot; it is an example of a mechanism for increasing adaptation 
when adaptation is need.  There is a certain type of enzyme which 
makes specific cuts in the DNA chain.  Biotechnologists find them 
convenient for their purposes, but their presence serves physiological 
purposes, presumably in all organisms, like those described by McClintock 
in corn.  During the terminal stress that produces the special 
kind of cell death known as apoptosis, these enzymes make confetti of 
the genome.</font></p></ul>

<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Poisons, 
such as estrogen, unsaturated fatty acids, or even radiation, produce 
different effects at different doses.  Low doses typically stimulate 
cell division, larger doses produce changes of cell type and altered 
states of differentiation, and finally, adequate doses produce apoptotic 
cell death.  There is a special ideology around apoptosis, which 
holds that it is &quot;genetically programmed,&quot; implying that whenever 
it occurs in the brain, it was destined to happen sooner or later.  
But in fact, &quot;growth factors&quot; of various sorts can prevent 
it.  It is increasingly clear that it represents excessive stress 
and deficient resources.  The involvement of the genetic apparatus 
in differentiation and radical adaptation suggests that the (epigenetic) 
resources of cells are unlimited.  </font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
changes that are known to be produced by the poisons that we are habitually 
exposed to are exactly the changes that occur in the aging brain.  
As I scan over hundreds of studies that define the effects of estrogen, 
unsaturated fats, excess iron, and lipid peroxidation, my argument seems 
commonplace, even trivial, except that I know that it clearly relates 
to therapies for most of the degenerative diseases, and that the great 
culture-machine is propagating a different view at several points that 
are essential for my argument.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">They 
are advancing a myth about human nature, so I will advance a counter-myth.  
At the time people were growing their large brains they lived in the 
tropics.  I suggest that in this time before the development of 
grain-based agriculture, they ate a diet that was relatively free of 
unsaturated fats and low in iron--based on tropical fruits.  I 
suggest that the Boskop skull from Mt. Kilimanjaro was representative 
of people under those conditions, and that just by our present knowledge 
of the association of brain size with longevity, they--as various &quot;Golden 
Age&quot; myths claim--must have had a very long life-span.  As 
people moved north and developed new ways of living, their consumption 
of unsaturated fats increased, their brain size decreased, and they 
aged rapidly.  Neanderthal relics show that flaxseed was a staple 
of their diet.</font></p></ul>

<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Even 
living in the tropics, there are many possibilities for diets rich in 
signal-disrupting substances, including iron, and in high latitudes 
there are opportunities for reducing our exposure to them.  As 
a source of protein, milk is uniquely low in its iron content.  
Potatoes, because of the high quality of their protein, are probably 
relatively free of toxic signal-substances.  Many tropical fruits, 
besides having relatively saturated fats, are also low in iron, and 
often contain important quantities of amino acids and proteins.  
In this context, Jeanne Calment's life-long, daily consumption of chocolate 
comes to mind:  As she approaches her 121st birthday, she is still 
eating chocolate, though she has stopped smoking and drinking wine.  
The saturated fats in chocolate have been found to block the toxicity 
of oils rich in linoleic acid, and its odd proteins seem to have an 
anabolic action.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">If 
we really take seriously even the traditional sort of epigenesis, and 
especially if we accept the deeper idea of epigenesis on the level of 
cellular structure and function, we have to see the organism as a sort 
of &quot;whirlwind of cells,&quot; made up of whirlwinds of atoms (in 
Vernadsky's phrase) in which our way of life sets the boundaries within 
which our cells will restructure themselves.  </font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
random production of free radicals, rather than acting only by way of 
genetic damage or protein cross-linking, is also able to act as a signalling 
process, that is, on a strictly physiological level.  An excess 
of unsaturated fatty acids itself constitutes a massive distortion of 
the regulatory systems, but it also leads to distortions in the &quot;eicosanoid&quot; 
system and the increasingly uncontrolled production of free radicals, 
and to changes in energy, thyroid activity, and steroid balance.  
The aging body, rather than being like a car that needs more and more 
repairs until it collapses from simple wear, is more like a car traveling 
a road that becomes increasingly rough and muddy, until the road becomes 
an impassable swamp.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
suggested therapy is a correction of the signalling process, rather 
than &quot;genetic surgery,&quot; transplantation, etc., which is the 
pessimistic implication of the doctrine that oxidative damage is simply 
a matter of &quot;wear and tear,&quot; &quot;somatic mutations,&quot; 

and &quot;cross-linking.&quot;  Those problems are reparable, and 
our emphasis should be on the production of energy and the avoidance 
of the conditions that allow the undesirable signals to accumulate.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
absence of cancer on a diet lacking unsaturated fats, the increased 
rate of metabolism, decreased free radical production, resistance to 
stress and poisoning by iron, alcohol, endotoxin, alloxan and streptozotocin, 
etc., improvement of brain structure and function, decreased susceptibility 
to blood clots, and lack of obesity and age pigment on a diet using 
coconut oil rather than unsaturated fats, indicates that something very 
simple can be done to reduce the suffering from the major degenerative 
diseases, and that it is very likely acting by reducing the aging process 
itself at its physiological core.</font> <br></p></ul>

to depend primarily upon the action of estrogen.&quot;  &quot;Glycolytic

Loeb, V. Suntzeff, and E. L. Burns, &quot;Changes in the nature of the 
stroma in vagina, cervix and uterus of the mouse produced by long-continued 
injections of estrogen and by advancing age,&quot; The American Journal 
of Cancer 35(2), 159-174, 1939.  Loeb, et al., speak of collagenous 
deposits as fibrous-hyaline tissue, varying from a fibrillar to a homogeneous 
appearance, and varying in consistency from very dense and glassy in 
appearance, to the softer gelatinous substance between cells and around 
arteries and glands.  This material increases with aging and eventually 
appears between cells in the muscular part of the uterus.  With 
the injection of moderate amounts of estrogen, the quantity of the material 
is increased.  When large amounts of estrogen are injected, &quot;The 
connective tissue and muscle appear rarefied, almost as though they 
were perforated by a large number of small holes.&quot;  &quot;...this 
condition is presumably due to a deposit of a mixture of hyaline material 
and edematous fluid....&quot;  &quot;This process of hyalinization...is 
counteracted by invasion by connective tissue.&quot;  In this way 
there may take place in many areas a substitution and organization of 
the hyaline material by connective tissue, in which dilated capillaries 
may also be visible.&quot;  &quot;There is a second process which 
in many cases accompanies the invasion and organization of hyaline substance 
by connective tissue, namely a formation, at the margin of the hyaline 
material, of epithelioid and of small giant cells possessing more than 
one nucleus.&quot;  &quot;As a rule, the epithelioid cells are 
seen alone; giant cells are more rare.&quot;  &quot;...the connective-tissue 
fibrils may in places appear somewhat separated, perhaps by edematous 
fluid.&quot;  &quot;The first changes consist very likely in the 
transudation of fluid from the vessels into the connective tissue.&quot;  

&quot;It seems, then, that at a very early stage after the beginning 
of the injections of effective doses of estrogen, a liquid substance 
which separates the connective-tissue elements makes its appearance, 
and that this represents one of the earliest changes induced by the 
hormone.  It may be accompanied, or soon followed, by the deposit 
of a hyaline substance which occurs first between the connective-tissue 
cells, but may extend also to the muscle fibers.&quot;  &quot;...the 
deposit of hyaline which progressively becomes more and more devoid 
of connective-tissue cells and blood vessels, is so marked that the 
material acts like a foreign body....&quot;  &quot;While it may 
be found also around blood vessels, such deposits are less conspicuous 
than in other organs in mice, such as the mammary gland....  There 
is a tendency for the hyaline substance to form sheaths around various 
organs and it is more prominent at the border separating different tissues 
and organs.&quot;  &quot;In its appearance and in the foreign body 
reactions which it initiates this substance somewhat resembles amyloid, 
which is readily produced in mice in various groups.  The application 
of stains differentiating amyloid from other hyaline material, however, 
gave negative results.&quot;</font></p></ul>

are deposited, which act as foreign bodies and cause the formation of 
epithelioid and giant cells and an ingrowth of connective tissue.  
Thus an organization of this substance is attempted, which is interrupted, 
however, by renewed deposition of this hyaline material.&quot;  
&quot;No definite statement can be made at present as to the chemical 
nature of this substance and its possible relation to a plasma constituent, 
except that it is not amyloid.&quot;  &quot;...a very intense fibrosis

lower PKC activity in liver plasma membranes with slight but significant 
reduction of the activity in the cytosol than did rats fed safflower 
oil....&quot;  &quot;...coconut oil resulted in a higher content 
of diacylglycerols in these membranes than did ingestion of safflower 
oil, whereas the proportions of saturated fatty acids and phospholipids 
and membrane fluidity were similar between rats ingesting different 
fats.&quot;  &quot;It seems likely that saturated fats exert various 
physiological effects on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, in part through 
PKC pathways.&quot;</font></p></ul>

Loeb, V. Suntzeff, and E. L. Burns, &quot;Changes in the nature of the 
stroma in vagina, cervix and uterus of the mouse produced by long-continued 
injections of estrogen and by advancing age,&quot; The American Journal 
of Cancer 35(2), 159-174, 1939.  Loeb, et al., speak of collagenous 
deposits as fibrous-hyaline tissue, varying from a fibrillar to a homogeneous 
appearance, and varying in consistency from very dense and glassy in 
appearance, to the softer gelatinous substance between cells and around 
arteries and glands.  This material increases with aging and eventually 
appears between cells in the muscular part of the uterus.  With 
the injection of moderate amounts of estrogen, the quantity of the material 
is increased.  When large amounts of estrogen are injected, &quot;The 
connective tissue and muscle appear rarefied, almost as though they 
were perforated by a large number of small holes.&quot;  &quot;...this 
condition is presumably due to a deposit of a mixture of hyaline material 
and edematous fluid....&quot;  &quot;This process of hyalinization...is 
counteracted by invasion by connective tissue.&quot;  In this way 
there may take place in many areas a substitution and organization of 
the hyaline material by connective tissue, in which dilated capillaries 
may also be visible.&quot;  &quot;There is a second process which 
in many cases accompanies the invasion and organization of hyaline substance 
by connective tissue, namely a formation, at the margin of the hyaline 
material, of epithelioid and of small giant cells possessing more than 
one nucleus.&quot;  &quot;As a rule, the epithelioid cells are 
seen alone; giant cells are more rare.&quot;  &quot;...the connective-tissue 
fibrils may in places appear somewhat separated, perhaps by edematous 
fluid.&quot;  &quot;The first changes consist very likely in the 
transudation of fluid from the vessels into the connective tissue.&quot;  

&quot;It seems, then, that at a very early stage after the beginning 
of the injections of effective doses of estrogen, a liquid substance 
which separates the connective-tissue elements makes its appearance, 
and that this represents one of the earliest changes induced by the 
hormone.  It may be accompanied, or soon followed, by the deposit 
of a hyaline substance which occurs first between the connective-tissue 
cells, but may extend also to the muscle fibers.&quot;  &quot;...the 
deposit of hyaline which progressively becomes more and more devoid 
of connective-tissue cells and blood vessels, is so marked that the 
material acts like a foreign body....&quot;  &quot;While it may 
be found also around blood vessels, such deposits are less conspicuous 
than in other organs in mice, such as the mammary gland....  There 
is a tendency for the hyaline substance to form sheaths around various 
organs and it is more prominent at the border separating different tissues 
and organs.&quot;  &quot;In its appearance and in the foreign body 
reactions which it initiates this substance somewhat resembles amyloid, 
which is readily produced in mice in various groups.  The application 
of stains differentiating amyloid from other hyaline material, however, 
gave negative results.&quot;</font> <br></p></ul>

on the stroma of vagina, cervix and uterus in the mouse,&quot; Science 
88(22, Nov. 4), 1938.  &quot;...large amounts of a hyaline substance 
are deposited, which act as foreign bodies and cause the formation of 
epithelioed and giant cells and an ingrowth of connective tissue.  
Thus an organization of this substance is attempted, which is interrupted, 
however, by renewed deposition of this hyaline material.&quot;  
&quot;No definite statement can be made at present as to the chemical 
nature of this substance and its possible relation to a plasma constituent, 
except that it is not amyloid.&quot;  &quot;...a very intense fibrosis 
and hyalinization of the stroma which may induce abnormal reactions 
in the surrounding tissue.  In this way it seems to be possible
