Vitamin E: Estrogen antagonist, energy promoter, and anti-inflammatory</b><br></font> 

<i><p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Vitamin 
E, like progesterone and aspirin, acts within the cellular regulatory 
systems, to prevent inflammation and inappropriate excitation. Since 
uncontrolled excitation causes destructive 
oxidations, these substances prevent those forms of oxidation. </font></p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Molecules 
that can easily be oxidized and reduced can function as antioxidants, 
and vitamin E does function as that kind of antioxidant in many chemical 
environments. But it is highly misleading to consider that as the explanation 
for its many beneficial biological effects. That kind of reasoning contributed 
to the use of the antioxidant carcinogens 
BHT and BHA as food additives and &quot;antiaging&quot; supplements, 
and many other chemicals are being promoted on the basis of their abstract 
antioxidant function.</font></p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Becoming 
aware of the real value of vitamin E will have far reaching implications 
in nutrition and medicine.</font> <br></p>

<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In determining 
criminal or civil legal responsibility, the concept &quot;should have 
known&quot; is recognized and used. In science, which is all about knowing, 
there is certainly a responsibility to be informed when the subject 
involves the life and health of millions of people. The science establishment 
of government and industry should be held responsible for the information 
it hides, destroys, or ignores for its own benefit. The US government 
has an agency for prosecuting research fraud, but the concept is applied 
so narrowly as to be meaningless, when deception has become the rule. 
And since it controls the court system, 
govenment agencies and their functionaries won't be prosecuted, even 
when their crimes become well known. </font></p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">&quot;Vitamin 
E was advocated as an effective treatment for heart disease by Dr. Ev<i>an 
Shute of London, Ontario more than 50 years ago.</i><i> </i>
<i>His pioneering claims, which were unacceptable to the medical 
community at large, have been confirmed by recent findings from 
epidemiologic studies and clinical trials.</i><i>&quot; </i></font></p></i>

<hr size=1 width=75%>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Political 
scientists have recognized the process in which big corporations &quot;capture&quot; 

the governmental agencies that were created to regulate them. The editorial 
boards of professional journals can be captured even more cheaply than 
the agencies of government, and their influence can be even more valuable 
to industry. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">If 
science impinges upon the plans of an industry, it can be managed into 
compliance, when the industry controls the journals and the agencies 
that fund research.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
the 1940s, it had already become clear to the estrogen industry that 
vitamin E research was impinging on its vital interests.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
Manhattan Project, that created the atomic bomb, also created a generation 
of scientific and bureaucratic zealots who ignored public health and 
safety to advance their projects and their careers, and changed the 
way science was done. At exactly the same time, the pharmaceutical industry 
was using its financial and political power to change the way medicine 
was practiced and taught, and the consequences for world health rivalled 
those of the nuclear industry.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
1933 the physician R.J. Shute was aware of the problems associated with 
toxemia of pregnancy or preeclampsia. Especially among poorly nourished 
women, many pregnancies were complicated by circulatory problems, including 
cyclic bleeding, thrombosis, stroke, and hypertension, and these difficult 
pregnancies often ended in miscarriage or premature delivery, resulting 
in many serious health problems among the babies that survived. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">At 
that time, both estrogen and vitamin E were being widely studied, though 
the exact structure of the tocopherol molecule wasn't defined until 
1936-37. Vitamin E had been found to improve fertility of both male 
and female animals, and to prevent intrauterine death of the embryo 
or fetus, so it was called the &quot;antisterility vitamin.&quot; Using 
it to prevent women from having miscarriages must have occurred to many 
people.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Animal 
research in the 1930s was also showing that estrogen had many toxic 
effects, including causing infertility or intrauterine death, connective 
tissue abnormalities, and excessive blood clotting. Dr. Shute and his 
sons, Wilfred and Evan, were among those who considered vitamin E to 
be an antiestrogen. They found that it was very effective in preventing 
the clotting diseases of pregnancy.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Other 
researchers, who knew that progesterone protected against the toxic 
effects of estrogen, described vitamin E as the &quot;progesterone-sparing 
agent,&quot; since so many of its antiestrogenic effects resembled those 
of progesterone. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
Shute brothers began using vitamin E to treat circulatory diseases in 
general, rather than just in pregnant women--blood clots, phlebitis, 
hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes all responded well to treatment 
with large doses.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Vitamin 
E, as its name indicates, was the fifth type of &quot;vitamin&quot; 
factor to be identified, and it received its name in 1922, even though 
its chemical structure hadn't been identified. The public quickly understood 
and accepted that certain substances in food were essential for life 
and health, so by 1940 practically all physicians were recommending 
the use of nutritional supplements.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">If 
vitamin E was essential for human health, and achieved at least some 
of its amazing effects by opposing estrogen, then the synthetic estrogen 
industry had a problem.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Edward 
L. Bernays had already been in business for decades, teaching corporations 
and governments how to &quot;engineer consent.&quot; After his work 
for the government to engineer support for entering the first world 
war, Bernays' next big job was for the tobacco industry. To convince 
women to smoke cigarettes, to achieve equality with men, he organized 
an Easter parade, Torches of Freedom, in which thousands of women marched 
smoking their freedom torches. In association with the American Medical 
Association (the editor of JAMA actually helped the tobacco industry 
design its campaigns), Bernays ran a campaign to convince Americans 
that smoking was good for the health.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
drug industry began using his techniques in sometimes crude but always 
effective ways. Estrogen was named &quot;the female hormone;&quot; natural 
hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, were claimed, without 
any research, to be inactive when taken orally. Physician-shills were 
created to claim wonderful effects for estrogen. The vitamin status 
of the tocopherols was denied; as recently as the 1970s (and maybe later), 
university professors of dietetics were flatly saying &quot;no one needs 
vitamin E.&quot; </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Very 
little research showing the curative effects of vitamin E in human diseases 
was allowed to be published, so it was only occasionally necessary to 
openly denounce vitamin E as worthless or dangerous. In 1981, the journal 
of the AMA published an article reviewing the &quot;toxic&quot; effects 
of vitamin E. Since I had read all of the articles cited, I realized 
that the author was claiming that whenever vitamin E changed something, 
the change was harmful, even though the original publication had described 
the effect as beneficial. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
JAMA was eventually forced to give up its revenue from cigarette advertising, 
it didn't suffer at all, because of the vast advertising campaigns of 
the estrogen industry. JAMA obviously wouldn't want to publish anything 
suggesting that vitamin E, or progesterone, or thyroid, might be beneficial 
because of its antagonism of the harmful effects of estrogen.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen 
causes changes in the uterus that prevent implantation of the embryo, 
and that impair support for its development if it has already implanted. 
It decreases the availability of oxygen to the embryo, while vitamin 
E increases it.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">My 
dissertation adviser, A.L. Soderwall, did a series of experiments in 
which he showed that providing hamsters with extra vitamin E postponed 
the onset of infertility in middle age. In my experiments, vitamin E 
increased the amount of oxygen in the uterus, correcting an oxygen deficiency 
produced either by supplemental estrogen or by old age. Progesterone 
has similar effects on the delivery of oxygen to the uterus.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
the 1940s, the official definition of vitamin E's activity was changed. 
Instead of its effectiveness in preventing the death and resorption</font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"> of embryos, or the degeneration of 
the testicles or brain or muscles, it was redefined as an antioxidant, 
preventing the oxidation of unsaturated oils.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
some people continued to think of it as a protective factor against 
thrombosis, heart attacks, diabetes, and infertility, the medical establishment 
claimed that the prevention or cure of diseases in animals wasn't relevant 
to humans, and that a mere antioxidant couldn't prevent or cure any 
human disease.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
experiments that led to the identification of vitamin E involved feeding 
rats a diet containing rancid lard and, as a vitamin A supplement, cod 
liver oil. Both of these contained large amounts of polyunsaturated 
oils. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">From 
1929 to the early 1930s, other researchers were claiming to have demonstrated 
that the polyunsaturated fatty acids were nutritionally essential. These 
experiments, like the vitamin E experiments, were done on rats, but 
the medical establishment was satisfied that rat experiments proved 
that humans need linoleic or linolenic acid, while they refused to accept 
that vitamin E was essential for humans. When, in the 1940s, a group 
of vitamin B6 researchers showed that the supposed &quot;essential fatty 
acid deficiency&quot; could be cured by a supplement of vitamin B6, 
it became apparent that the polyunsaturated fatty acids slowed metabolism, 
and reduced all nutritional needs. The thyroid hormone was powerfully 
suppressed by the &quot;essential&quot; fatty acids. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">When 
we consider the two sets of experiments together, their outstanding 
feature is the toxicity of the polyunsaturated oils, which in one kind 
of experiment suppressed metabolism, and in the other kind of experiment 
created a variety of degenerative conditions. </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">By 
the late 1940s and early 1950s, estrogens of various sorts had been 
synthesized from hydrocarbons, and were being recommended to prevent 
miscarriages, because &quot;estrogen is the female hormone.&quot; The 
meat industry had found that the polyunsaturated oils were valuable 
in animal feed, since they suppressed metabolism and made it cheaper 
to fatten the animals, and these antithyroid oils were next marketed 
as &quot;heart protective&quot; human foods, though by suppressing the 
thyroid and destroying vitamin E, they actually contributed to both 
heart disease and cancer. (Giving estrogen to livestock to improve their 
feed efficiency, and to people &quot;to prevent heart attacks,&quot; 
was an interesting parallel to the oil promotional campaigns.) </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
influence of the food oil industry kept researchers away from the idea 
that these oils were not safe for food use, and instead tended to support 
the idea that vitamin E is just an antioxidant, and that the seed oils 
were the best way to get vitamin E in the diet.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
antifertility effects of the polyunsaturated oils, demonstrated in the 
vitamin E experiments, weren't at the time understood to have anything 
to do with estrogen's antifertility effects. But to understand vitamin 
E, I think we have to consider the close interactions between estrogen 
and the polyunsatured fatty acids (PUFA). Their actions are closely 
intertwined, and are antagonized by a variety of energizing and stabiliizing 
substances, including saturated fats, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin 
E, and aspirin.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Generally, 
chemicals that inhibit enzymes are toxic, producing some sort of symptom 
or deterioration. But a group of enzymes related to estrogen and PUFA 
are inhibited by these protective substances. Although under our present 
diet, these enzymes metabolize the </font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">PUFA, 
in the fetus and newborn they act on our endogenous fats, the series 
related to the Mead acids. The Mead acid is antiinflammatory, and broadly 
protective. The dietary PUFA interfere with these natural protective 
substances,</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
enzymes that, if we didn’t eat PUFA, would be regulating the Mead 
series, being activated in response to stress, would be producing antistress 
substances, which would limit the stress reaction. But as we become 
increasingly saturated with the anti-vitamin E fats, these enzymes, 
instead of stopping inflammation, promote it and cause tissue injury. 
The remaining stress limiting factors, such as progesterone, by correcting 
the distortions caused by stress, tend to eliminate the conditions which 
activated the enzymes--in a very indirect form of inhibition.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Many 
of the events involved in inflammation are increased by estrogen, and 
decreased by vitamin E. Estrogen causes capillaries to become leaky; 
vitamin E does the opposite. Estrogen increases platelet aggregation, 
and decreases a factor that inhibits platelet aggregation; vitamin E 
does the opposite. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Excess 
clotting is known to be caused by too much estrogen, and also by a vitamin 
E deficiency.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Clotting 
leads to fibrosis, and there is clear evidence that vitamin E prevents 
and cures fibrotic diseases, but this still isn't generally accepted 
by the powerful medical institutions. Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats 
increase fibrosis. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen 
increases progstaglandin synthesis, vitamin E decreases their synthesis; 
estrogen increases the activity of the enzymes COX and LOX, vitamin 
E decreases their activitiy. (Jiang, et al., 2000; Ali, et al., 1980; 
Parkhomets, et al., 2001.) Estrogen releases enzymes from lysosomes, 
vitamin E inhibits their release. Beta-glucuronidase, one of these enzymes, 
can release estrogen at the site of an inflammation.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen 
often increases intracellular calcium and protein kinase C, vitamin 
E has generally opposite effects. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
polyunsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives, the prostaglandins, 
act as effectors</font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">, or amplifiers, 
of estrogen's actions. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">If 
vitamin E is acting as a protectant against the polyunsaturated fatty 
acids, that in itself would account for at least some of its antiestrogenic 
effects.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Besides 
antagonizing some of the end effects of the toxic fatty acids, vitamin 
E inhibits lipolysis, lowering the concentration of free fatty acids 
(the opposite of estrogen’s effect), and it also binds to, and inactivates, 
free fatty acids. The long saturated carbon chain is very important 
for its full functioning, and this saturated chain might allow it to 
serve as a substitute for the omega -9 fats, from which the Mead acid 
is formed. The unsaturated tocotrienols have hardly been tested for 
the spectrum of true vitamin E activity, and animal studies have suggested 
that it may be toxic, since it caused liver enlargement.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">One 
possibly crucial protective effect of vitamin E against the polyunsaturated 
fatty acids that hasn't been explored is the direct destruction of linolenic 
and linoleic acid. It is known that <b>bacterial vitamin E is involved 
in the saturation of unsaturated fatty acids, and it is also known that 
intestinal bacteria turn linoleic and 
linolenic acids into the fully saturated 
stearic acid.</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>&quot;No 
metabolic function is known for alpha-tocopherolquinol or its 
quinone other than as a cofactor in the 
biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids that can be carried out 
by only a few organisms.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>               
<i>P.E. Hughes and S.B. Tove, 1982.</i></b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b><i>“Linoleic 
acid was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.001) and there was a significant 
rise (P &lt; 0.05) in its hydrogenation product, 
stearic acid. Linolenic acid was also significantly decreased. . . .” 
“The study provides evidence that bacteria from the human colon can 
hydrogenate C18 essential polyunsaturated fatty acids.”</i></b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><i>           
 F.A. Howard &amp; C. </i></font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><i>Henderson, 
1999</i></font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Because 
of the way in which the decision to call vitamin E a simple antioxidant 
was conditioned by the historical setting, there has been a reluctance, 
until recently, to give much weight to the pathogenicity of lipid peroxidation 
and free radicals, partly because lipid peroxidation is only a minor 
part of the toxicity of the polyunsaturated oils, and there was little 
support for the investigation of the real nature of their toxicity. 
This environment has even distorted the actual antioxidant value of 
the various forms of vitamin E. (For example, see Chen, et al., 2002.)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
people who say that vitamin E is nothing but an antioxidant sometimes 
take other antioxidants, with, or instead of, vitamin E. BHT, BHA, and 
many natural compounds (derived from industrial and agricultural wastes) 
are often said to be &quot;better than vitamin E&quot; as antioxidants. 
Anything that can be oxidized and reduced (melatonin, estrogen, tryptophan, 
carotene, etc.) will function as an antioxidant in some system, but 
in other circumstances, it can be a pro-oxidant. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
people who think there is benefit in the abstract &quot;antioxidant&quot; 
function seem to be thinking in terms of something that will, like a 
ubiquitous fire department, put out every little fire as soon as it 
starts. I think it's more appropriate to think of the biological antioxidant 
systems as programs for controlling the arsonists before they can set 
the fires.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Since 
the requirement for vitamin E decreases as the consumption of unsaturated 
fats decreases, the requirement, if any, would be very small if we didn't 
eat significant quantities of those fats.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
the years since the tocopherols were identified as vitamin E, the material 
sold for research and for use as a nutritional supplement has changed 
drastically several times, even when it has been given a specific chemical 
identity, such as mixed tocopherols or d-alpha tocopherol. Variations 
in viscosity and color, caused by changes in the impurities, have undoubtedly 
influenced its biological effects, but the ideology about its antioxidant 
value has kept researchers from finding out what a particular batch 
of it really is and what it really does. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>&quot;We 
compared the effect of a mixed tocopherol preparation with that of 
alpha-tocopherol alone on superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) activity and iNOS expression in cultured 
myocytes exposed to </b></font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>H-R.&quot; 
&quot;Both tocopherol preparations attenuated cell injury. . . .” 
“However, mixed-tocopherol preparation was much superior to 
alpha-tocopherol in terms of myocyte protection. . . .” “Lack of 
efficacy of commercial tocopherol preparations in clinical trials may 
reflect absence of gamma- and delta-tocopherols.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Chen<i> 
H, Li D, Saldeen T, Romeo F, Mehta 
JL,Biochem Biophys Res Commun  2002 &quot;Mixed 
tocopherol preparation is superior to 
alpha-tocopherol alone against hypoxia-reoxygenation injury.&quot;</i></b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Keeping 
our diet as free as possible of the polyunsaturated fats, to create 
something like the &quot;deficiency&quot; state that is so protective 
(against cancer, trauma, poison, shock, inflammation, infection, etc.) 
in the animal experiments, seems preferable to trying to saturate ourselves 
with antioxidants, considering the imperfectly defined nature of the 
vitamin E products, and the known toxicity of many of the other antioxidants 
on the market.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
carcinogenic properties of the polyunsaturated fats have been known 
for more than 50 years, as has the principle of extending the life span 
by restricted feeding. More recently several studies have demonstrated 
that the long lived species contain fewer highly unsaturated fats than 
the short lived species. <b>Restriction of calories prevents the lipids 
in the brain, heart, and liver from becoming more unsaturated with aging.</b> 
(Lee, et al., 1999; Laganiere, et al., 1993; Tacconi, et al., 1991; 
R. Patzelt-Wenczler, 1981.)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">When 
cells are grown in tissue culture without the “essential fatty acids,” 
they become “deficient,” and in that state are very resistant to 
chemical injury, and can be grown indefinitely. Besides being a simple 
demonstration of the way in which the polyunsaturated fats sensitize 
cells to injury (Wey, et al., 1993), these experiments must be an embarrassment 
to the people who base their argument for the oils’ essentiality on

the opposite direction, an excess of insulin or prolactin, or a deficiency

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
highly unsaturated fats suppress respiration in many ways, and these 
trends toward increased unsaturation with aging, endocrine stress, and 
vitamin E deficiency parallel the life-long trend toward lower energy 
production from respiration. Many studies show that vitamin E can protect 
and improve mitochondrial energy production. (Kikuchi, et al., 1991; 
Donchenko, et al., 1990, 1983; Guarnieri, et al., 1981, 1982.) But the 
state of so-called essential fatty acid deficiency not only makes mitochondria 
very resistant to injury, it greatly intensifies their energy production. 
Vitamin E supplementation is seldom as effective as the absence of the 
toxic oils.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Many 
nutrition charts no longer list liver as a good source of vitamin E, 
but a large portion of an animal’s vitamin E is in its liver. This 
bias in the dietetic literature can be traced to various sources, but 
a major influence was the campaign in the 1970s by the drug companies 
that had patented new forms of synthetic “vitamin A.” They had physicians 
and professors fabricate stories about the great toxicity of natural 
vitamin A, and placed the stories in national magazines, to clear the 
field for their supposedly non-toxic products, which have turned out 
to be disastrously toxic. The result is that many people have fearfully 
stopped eating liver, because of its vitamin A. The other vitamins in 
liver, including vitamin K, function very closely with vitamin E, and 
the stably stored forms of vitamin E are likely to be a good approximation 
for our needs.  </font></p>

vitamin E as an antioxidant, M.K. Horwitt, complained when the government 
raised its recommended vitamin E intake by 50%, because it wasn’t 
supported by new data, and because millions of people get only ten milligrams 
per day and “are healthy.” But he has been taking 200 mg daily (plus 
aspirin) for many years. He apparently doesn't have very much confidence

keratinocytes are commonly grown in culture with a serum-free medium. 
Under these conditions, keratinocytes become essential fatty acid deficient 
(EFAD), as determined by gas chromatographic analysis of cell 
phospholipid fatty acid composition. Exposure of 
EFAD keratinocytes for 2 hr to concentrations of 
t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) up to 2 
mM did not result in toxicity assessed by lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) release and only a small indication of lipid 
peroxidation assessed by the release of 
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances</b> (TBARS). Addition of 10 
microM linoleic acid (LA) to serum-free medium alleviated the EFAD condition 
by increasing the phospholipid content of LA and its elongation and 
desaturation products, arachidonic acid and docosatetraenoic acid. Exposure 
of LA-supplemented keratinocytes to tBHP resulted in significant LDH 
(at 1 and 2 mM tBHP) and TBARS (tBHP concentration dependent) release. 
TBARS release was also significantly elevated in unexposed LA-supplemented 
keratinocytes (basal release). Co-supplementation with the antioxidant,<b> 
alpha-tocopherol succinate (TS) prevented 
tBHP (1 mM)-induced LDH release in LA-supplemented cultures. TS supplementation 
also attenuated the effect of tBHP on 
TBARS release, but when compared to TS-supplemented 
EFAD cultures, LA</b> supplementation still led to increased tBHP-induced 
TBARS release. Keratinocyte cultures are potentially useful as an alternative 
to animals in toxicology research and testing. It is important, however, 
that the cell model provide a response to toxic insult similar to that 
experienced in vivo. Our results suggest that fatty acid and antioxidant 
nutrition of cultured keratinocytes are important parameters in mediating 
the toxic effects of lipid peroxidation.</font></p>

   <font size="2" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">&quot;The 
response-to-injury hypothesis explains 
atherosclerosis as a chronic inflammatory response to injury of the 
endothelium, which leads to complex cellular and molecular interactions 
among cells derived from the endothelium, smooth muscle and several 
blood cell components. Inflammatory and other stimuli trigger an overproduction 
of free radicals, which promote peroxidation of lipids in LDL trapped 
in the subendothelial space. Products of LDL oxidation are 
bioactive, and they induce endothelial expression and secretion 
of cytokines, growth factors and several cell surface adhesion molecules. 
The last-mentioned are capable of recruiting circulating 
monocytes and T 
lymphocytes into the intima where monocytes are differentiated into macrophages, 
the precursor of foam cells. In response to the growth factors and cytokines, 
smooth muscle cells proliferate in the 
intima, resulting in the narrowing 
of the lumen. Oxidized LDL can also inhibit endothelial production of prostacyclin 
and nitric oxide, two potent autacoids that are vasodilators and inhibitors 
of platelet aggregation. Evidence is presented that vitamin E is protective 
against the development of atherosclerosis.  Vitamin E enrichment 
has been shown 
to retard LDL oxidation, inhibit the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, inhibit 
platelet adhesion and aggregation, inhibit the expression and function 
of adhesion molecules, attenuate the synthesis of leukotrienes and potentiate 
the release of prostacyclin through up-regulating the expression of cytosolic 
phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase. Collectively, these biological functions 
of vitamin E may account for its protection against the development 
of atherosclerosis."</font><br>

   Vitamin A 
and related essential nutrients in cord blood: relationships with 

   anthropometric 
measurements at birth.

   Following 
the advice given by the Department of Health to women who are, or may

   become pregnant, 
not to eat liver and liver products because of the risk of
   vitamin A 
toxicity, the concentrations of vitamins A and E, and copper,
   magnesium 
and zinc in cord blood were investigated. The study was conducted in
   Hackney, 
an inner city area of London. Esters of vitamin A were not detected 
in
   any of the 
samples, indicating that there was no biochemical evidence of a risk
   of toxicity. 
Indeed, vitamin A correlated significantly with birthweight, head

   circumference, 
length, and gestation period. There was also a significant
   positive 
relationship between zinc and birthweight. In contrast, copper showed 
a
   negative 
correlation with birthweight and head circumference. Vitamin E and
   magnesium 
were not associated with any of the anthropometric measurements,
   although 
magnesium showed an increasing trend with birthweight. The data suggest
   that most 
of the mothers of the subjects studied may have been marginal with

   respect to 
vitamins A and E and zinc. In those with low birthweight babies. a
   higher intake 
would have improved their nutritional status and possibly the
   outcome of 
their pregnancy. For these low-income mothers, liver and liver
   products 
are the cheapest and the best source of vitamins A and E, haem iron, 
B
   vitamins 
and several other essential nutrients; hence the advice of the
   Department 
of Health may have been misplaced.</font></p>
