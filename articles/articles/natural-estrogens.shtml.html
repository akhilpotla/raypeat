fact that an extremely large number of naturally occurring compounds,

proprietary drugs, especially the contraceptives.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">       
Estrogen marketing has entered a new phase, based on the idea of “specific 
estrogen-receptor modulators,” the idea that a molecule can be designed 
which has estrogen&#39;s “good qualities without its bad qualities.”  
This specific molecule will be “good for the bones, the heart, and 
the brain,” without causing cancer of the breast and uterus, according 
to the estrogen industry.  Meanwhile, soybeans are said to contain 
estrogens that meet that goal, and it is often said that “natural 
estrogens” are better than “synthetic estrogens” because they 
are “balanced.”</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogen&#39;s 
effects  on cells are immediate and profound, independent of the 
“estrogen receptors.”</font> <br></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Japanese 
women&#39;s relative freedom from breast cancer is independent of soy products<b>:</b> 
traditional soy foods aren&#39;t the same as those so widely used in the 
US, for example, soy sauce doesn&#39;t contain the so-called soy estrogens, 
and tea is used much more commonly in Japan than in the US, and contains 
health protective ingredients.  The “estrogenic” and “antioxidant” 
polyphenolic compounds of tea are not the protective agents (they raise 
the level of estrogen), but tea&#39;s <i>caffeine</i> is a very powerful 
and general anti-cancer protectant.  The influential article in <i>
Lancet</i> (D. Ingram, <i>Lancet</i> 1997;<i>350</i>:990-994. “Phytoestrogens 
and their role in breast cancer,”<i> Breast NEWS: Newsletter of the 
NHMRC National Breast Cancer Centre, Vol. 3,</i> No. 2, Winter 1997) 
used a method known to produce false results, namely, comparing the 
phytoestrogens (found in large amounts in soybeans) in the urine of 
women with or without breast cancer.  For over fifty years, it 
has been known that the liver excretes estrogens and other toxins from 
the body, and that when (because of liver inertia) estrogen isn&#39;t excreted 
by the liver and kidneys, it is retained in the body.  This process 
was observed in both animals and humans decades ago, and it is <i>also 
well established that estrogen itself suppresses the detoxifying systems, 
causing fewer carcinogens to be excreted</i> in the urine.  Ingram&#39;s 
evidence logically would suggest that the women who have cancer are 
failing to eliminate estrogens, including phytoestrogens, at a normal 
rate, and so are retaining a higher percentage of the chemicals consumed 
in their diets.  Flavonoids and polyphenols, like our own estrogens, 
suppress the detoxifying systems of the body.</font> <br></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Our 
bodies produce estrogen in a great variety of tissues, not just in the 
ovaries.  Fat cells are a major source of it.  The tendency 
to gain weight after puberty is one of the reasons that women&#39;s estrogen 
levels rise with aging throughout the reproductive years, though this 
isn&#39;t the basic reason for estrogen&#39;s lifelong growing influence, even 
in men.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Our 
diets provide very significant, if not always dangerous, amounts of 
estrogen.  “Weak estrogens” generally have the full range of 
harmful estrogenic effects, and often have additional toxic effects.  
American women who eat soy products undergo changes that appear to predispose 
them to cancer, making their tissues even more unlike those of the relatively 
breast-cancer resistant Japanese than they were before eating the soy 
foods.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">People 
under stress, or who have a thyroid deficiency, or who don&#39;t eat enough 
protein, typically have elevated estrogen levels.  The accumulation 
of the “essential fatty acids,” the polyunsaturated oils, in the 
tissues promotes the action of estrogen in a variety of ways, and this 
effect of diet tends to be cumulative, and to be self-accelerating.</font> <br>
</p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Science 
is a method that helps us to avoid believing things that are wrong, 
but there is a distinct herd instinct among people who “work in science,” 
which makes it easy to believe whatever sounds plausible, if a lot of 
other people are saying it is true.  This is just as evident in 
physics as it is in medicine.  Sometimes powerful economic interests 
help people to change their beliefs, for example as the insurance industry 
helped to convince the public of the dangers of smoking.  Two of 
the biggest industries in the world, the estrogen industry and the soy 
bean industry, spend vast amounts of money helping people to believe 
certain plausible-sounding things that help them sell their products.  
Sometimes they can achieve great things just by naming the substance.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Estrogenicity 
can be defined most simply as “acting the way estrogen does,” (originally, 
the term “estrogen” meant “producing estrus,” the female readiness 
to mate) and since our natural estrogen does many things, the definition 
is often, for practicality, based on the rapid changes produced in certain 
female organs by estradiol, specifically, the enlargement of the uterus 
by first taking up a large amount of water, and secondarily by the multiplication 
of cells and the production of specific proteins.  A similar process 
occurring in the breast is also recognized as an important feature of 
the estrogen reaction, but as we try to define just what “estrogenicity” 
is, we see that there is something deeply wrong with this method of 
defining a hormone, because we are constantly learning more about the 
actions of estrogen, or of a specific form of the molecule.  Calling 
it “the female hormone” distracted attention from its many functions 
in the male, and led to great confusion about its antifertility actions 
and its other toxicities.  Many biologists called it “folliculin,” 
because of the ovarian follicle&#39;s significant role in its production, 
but the pharmaceutical industry succeeded in naming it in relation to <b><i>
one</i></b> of its functions, and then in extending that idea of it 
as “the producer of female receptivity” to the even more misleading 
idea that it is “the female hormone.”  But when people speak 
about the “estrogenicity” of a substance, they mean that it has 
properties that parallel those of “folliculin,” the particular group 
of ovarian hormones that includes estradiol, estrone, and estriol. </font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Over 
the last 100 years, thousands of publications about estrogen&#39;s toxicity 
have created a slight resistance to the consumption of the major estrogen 
products.  One ploy to overcoming this resistance is to call certain 
products “natural estrogen,” as distinguished from “synthetic 
estrogens.”  The <b>three</b> <b>main estrogens in our bodies 
are estradiol, estrone, and estriol, though there are many other minor 
variants on the basic molecule.</b>  These three estrogens, singly 
or in combinations, are being sold as natural estrogens, with their 
virtues explained in various ways.  Implicit in many of these explanations, 
is the idea that these are safer than synthetics.  They are sometimes 
contrasted to the “horse estrogen” in Premarin, as if they are better 
because they are like the estrogens that people produce.  But it 
was exactly the normal human estrogens, produced by the ovaries, that 
led to the basic discoveries about the toxicity of estrogen, its ability 
to produce cancer in any organ, to cause seizures, blood clots, birth 
defects, accelerated aging, etc.  </font> <br></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
I would suppose that a hormone from a horse might be “more natural” 
for a person&#39;s body than a hormone from a plant, the word “natural” 
as used in the phrases “natural food store,” or “natural medicine,” 
has come to be associated strongly with things derived from plants.  
The health food industry, now largely taken over by giant corporations 
to sell products that weren&#39;t producing as much revenue when sold in 
supermarkets and drugstores, has helped to create a culture in which 
botanical products are thought to be especially good and safe.  
Naturally grown free-range chickens used to be favored, because they 
could eat anything they wanted, but now eggs laid by factory chickens, 
eating an industrial corn-and-soy diet, are from “vegetarian chickens,” 
because the marketers know the public will favor eggs that have the 
vegetarian mystique.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Biologically 
active molecules have both general and specific properties.  Estrogenicity 
is a general property, but all molecules which have that property also 
have some other specific properties.  Estriol is a little more 
water soluble than estrone, so it interacts with every body system in 
a slightly different way, entering oily environments with slightly less 
ease, etc.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
estrogen which occurs in yeasts, estradiol, is identical to the major 
human estrogen, and it is thought to have a reproductive function in 
yeasts, though this isn&#39;t really understood.  A feature of this 
molecule, and of all other molecules that “act like estrogen,” is 
the phenolic function, an oxygen and hydrogen group attached to a resonant 
benzene ring.  Phenol itself is estrogenic, and the phenolic group 
is so extremely common in nature that the number of existing estrogenic 
substances is great, and the number of potential molecules with estrogen-function 
is practically infinite.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
phenolic group has many biological functions.  For example, it 
commonly functions as an “antioxidant,” though something which functions 
as an antioxidant in one situation is often a pro-oxidant in another 
situation.  The molecule can have catalytic, germicidal, aromatic, 
neurotropic, and other functions.  But it also always has, to some 
degree, the “estrogenic” function.  This overlap of functions 
probably accounts for why so many plants have significant estrogenic 
activity.  (Natural estrogens, like other phenolics, including 
the flavonoids, are also mutagenic.)</font> <br></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
estrogenic properties of legumes were studied when sheep farmers found 
that their sheep miscarried when they ate clover. (I think it&#39;s interesting 
how this terribly toxic effect has been neglected in recent decades.) 
All legumes have this property, and all parts of the plant seem to contain 
some of the active chemicals.  In beans, several substances have 
been found to contribute to the effect.  The estrogenic effects 
of the seed oils and the isoflavones have been studied the most, but 
the well-known antithyroid actions (again, involving the oils, the isoflavones, 
and other molecules found in legumes) have an indirect estrogen-promoting 
action, since hypothyroidism leads to hyperestrogenism.  (Estrogens 
are known to be thyroid suppressors, so the problem tends to be self-accelerating.)</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
various specific actions of the many estrogenic substances in beans 
and other legumes haven&#39;t been throughly studied, but there is evidence 
that they are also--like estrogen itself--both mutagenic and carcinogenic. </font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
estrogen-promoting actions of soy oil apply to <b>all of the commonly 
used polyunsaturated fatty acids.  The same fatty acids that suppress 
thyroid function, have estrogenic effects.</b></font> <br></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
isoflavones (many of which are now being promoted as “antioxidants” 
and “cancer preventives”)  are toxic to many organs, but they 
have clear estrogenic effects, and are active not only immediately in 
the mature individual, but when they are present prenatally, they cause 
feminization of the male genitalia and behavior, and early maturation 
of the female offspring, with the tissue changes that are known to be 
associated with increased incidence of cancer.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">There 
are interesting associations between vegetable “fiber” and estrogens. 
Because of my own experience in finding that eating a raw carrot daily 
prevented my migraines, I began to suspect that the carrot fiber was 
having both a bowel-protective and an antiestrogen effect.  Several 
women who suffered from premenstrual symptoms, including migraine, had 
their serum estrogen measured before and after the “carrot diet,” 
and they found that the carrot lowered their estrogen within a few days, 
as it relieved their symptoms. </font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Undigestible 
fiber, if it isn&#39;t broken down by bowel bacteria, increases fecal bulk, 
and tends to speed the transit of material through the intestine, just 
as laxatives do.  But some of these “fiber” materials, e.g., 
lignin, are themselves estrogenic, and other fibers, by promoting bacterial 
growth, can promote the conversion of harmless substances into toxins 
and carcinogens.  When there is a clear “antiestrogen” effect 
from dietary fiber, it seems to be the result of accelerated transit 
through the intestine, speeding elimination and preventing reabsorption 
of the estrogen which has been excreted in the bile.  Laxatives 
have this same effect on the excretion of estradiol.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Some 
of the isoflavones, lignins, and other phytoestrogens are said to prevent 
bowel cancer, but some of them, e.g., lignin, appear to sometimes increase 
its likelihood. </font> <br></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
phytoestrogens appear to pose a risk to organs besides the breast and 
uterus, for example the liver, colon, and pancreas, which isn&#39;t surprising, 
since estrogen is known to be carcinogenic for every tissue.  And 
carcinogenesis, like precancerous changes, mutations, and reduced repair 
of DNA, is probably just an incidental process in the more general toxic 
effect of acceleration of aging.</font> <br></p>

&quot;Soy foods have been reported to have protective effects against 
premenopausal breast cancer in Asian women. No studies have been reported 
on potential physiological effects of dietary soy consumption on breast 
gland function. We evaluated the influence of the long-term ingestion 
of a commercial soy protein isolate on breast secretory activity. We 
hypothesized that the features of nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) of non-Asian 
women would be altered so as to resemble those previously found in Asian 
women. At monthly intervals for 1 year, 24 normal pre- and postmenopausal 
white women, ages 30 to 58, underwent nipple aspiration of breast fluid 
and gave blood and 24-h urine samples for biochemical studies. No soy 
was administered in months 1-3 and 10-12. Between months 4-9 the women 
ingested daily 38 g of soy protein isolate containing 38 mg of genistein. 
NAF volume, <b>gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP-15) concentration</b>, 
and NAF cytology were used as biomarkers of possible effects of soy 
protein isolate on the breast. In addition, plasma concentrations of 
estradiol, progesterone, sex hormone binding globulin, prolactin, cholesterol, 
high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured. 
Compliance was assessed by measurements of genistein and daidzein and 
their metabolites in 24-h urine samples. Excellent compliance with the 
study protocol was obtained. Compared with NAF volumes obtained in months 
1-3, <b>a 2-6-fold increase in NAF volume ensued during months 4-9 in 
all premenopausal women.</b> A minimal increase or no response was found 
in postmenopausal women. No changes were found in plasma prolactin, 
sex hormone binding globulin, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations. Compared with concentrations 
found in months 1-3 (no soy), <b>plasma estradiol concentrations were 
elevated erratically throughout </b>

a &quot;composite&quot; menstrual cycle during the months of soy consumption. 
No significant changes were seen in plasma progesterone concentrations. 
No significant changes were found in plasma estrogen levels in postmenopausal 
women. A moderate decrease occurred in the mean concentration of GCDFP-15 
in NAF in premenopausal women<u> during the months of soy ingestion. </u>
<b><u>Of potential concern was the cytological detection of epithelial 
hyperplasia in 7 of 24 women (29.2%) during the months they were consuming 
soy protein isolate. The findings did not support our a priori hypothesis. 
Instead, this pilot study indicates that prolonged consumption of soy 
protein isolate has a stimulatory effect on the premenopausal female 
breast, characterized by increased secretion of breast fluid, the appearance 
of hyperplastic epithelial cells,</u> and elevated levels of plasma 
estradiol. </b>These findings are suggestive of an estrogenic stimulus

measured to assess estrogenic response. <b>The percentage of vaginal

Some <b>phytoestrogens, such as genistein which is a major component

products, have estrogenic effects on the reproductive system, breast

to genistein or zearalenone influences mammary gland development. Pregnant 
mice were injected daily with i) 20 ng estradiol (E2); ii) 20 microg 
genistein; iii) 2 microg zearalenone; iv) 2 microg tamoxifen (TAM), 
a partial estrogen receptor agonist; or v) oil-vehicle between days

also increased epithelial density, when compared with the vehicle-controls. 
None of the treatments had permanent effects on circulating E2 levels. <b>
Maternal exposure to E2 accelerated body weight gain, physical maturation 
(eyelid opening), and puberty onset (vaginal opening) in the female 
offspring. Genistein and tamoxifen had similar effects on puberty onset 
than E2.</b> Zearalenone caused persistent cornification of the estrus 
smears. These findings indicate that <b>maternal exposure to physiological 
doses of genistein mimics the effects of E2 on the mammary gland and 
reproductive systems in the offspring. Thus, our results suggest that 
genistein acts as an estrogen in utero, and may increase the incidence 
of mammary tumors if given through a pregnant mother. </b>

The estrogenic effects of zearalenone on the mammary gland, in contrast, 
are probably counteracted by the permanent changes in estrus cycling.</font> <br>

Ishizuki Y; Hirooka Y; Murata Y; Togashi K Nippon Naibunpi Gakkai Zasshi, 
1991 May 20, 67:5, 622-9   To elucidate whether soybeans would 
suppress the thyroid function in healthy adults, we selected 37 subjects

given 30g of soybeans everyday and were divided into 3 groups subject 
to age and duration of soybean administration. In group 1, 20 subjects

Toxicol Environ Health, 1997 Jan, 50:1, 1-29.  Estrogen-like chemicals 
are unique compared to nonestrogenic xenobiotics, because in addition 
to their chemical properties, the estrogenic property of these compounds 
allows them to act like sex hormones. <b> Whether weak or strong, the 
estrogenic response of a chemical, if not overcome, will add extra estrogenic 
burden to the system.  At elevated doses, natural estrogens and 
environmental estrogen-like chemicals are known to produce adverse effects. 
The source of extra or elevated concentration of estrogen could be either 
endogenous or exogenous.</b> The potential of exposure for humans and 
animals to environmental estrogen-like chemicals is high. Only a limited 
number of estrogen-like compounds, such as diethylstilbestrol (DES), 
bisphenol A, nonylphenol, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 
(DDT), have been used to assess the biochemical and molecular changes 
at the cellular level. Among them, DES is the most extensively studied 
estrogen-like chemical, and therefore this article is focused mainly 
on DES-related observations. In addition to estrogenic effects, environmental 
estrogen-like chemicals <b>produce multiple and multitype genetic and/or 
nongenetic hits.</b> Exposure of Syrian hamsters to stilbene estrogen 
(DES) produces several changes in the nuclei of target organ for carcinogenesis 
(kidney): (1) Products of nuclear redox reactions of DES modify transcription 
regulating proteins and DNA; (2) transcription is inhibited; (3) tyrosine 
phosphorylation of nuclear proteins, including RNA polymerase II, p53, 
and nuclear insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, is altered; and (4<b>) 
DNA repair gene DNA polymerase beta transcripts are decreased and mutated.</b></font><font size="2" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"> Exposure of Noble rats to DES also 
produces several changes in the mammary gland: proliferative activity 
is drastically altered; the cell cycle of mammary epithelial cells is 
perturbed; telomeric length is attenuated; etc. It appears that some 
other estrogenic compounds, such as bisphenol A and nonylphenol, may 
also follow a similar pattern of effects to DES, because we have recently 
shown that these compounds <b>alter cell cycle kinetics, produce telomeric 
associations, and produce chromosomal aberrations. </b>

Like DES, bisphenol  A after metabolic activation is capable of 
binding to DNA. However, it should be noted that a particular or multitype 
hit(s) will depend upon the nature of the environmental estrogen-like 
chemical. The role of individual attack leading to a particular change 
is not clear at this stage.  Consequences of these multitypes of 
attack on the nuclei of cells could be (1) nuclear toxicity/cell death; 
(2) repair of all the hits and then acting as normal cells; or (3) sustaining 
most of the hits and acting as unstable cells.  Proliferation of 
the last type of cell is expected to result in transformed cells. </font> <br>

present study was designed to determine whether the modification of  
exposure time to large doses of estrogens provided a reliable model 
for early changes in reproductive aging. Silastic implants containing 
estradiol benzoate (EB) in solution were placed into 5-day-old female 
Wistar rats and removed 1 day (Ei1 group) or 5 days (Ei5) later. In 
addition, 100 mu-g EB dissolved in 100 mu-l corn oil was administered 
s.c. to another group (EI). Control rats received either vehicle implants 
or 100 mu-l corn oil. Premature occurrence of vaginal opening was observed 
in all three estrogenized groups independently of EB exposure.  
However, females bearing implants for 24 h had first estrus at the same 
age as their controls and cycled regularly, and neither histological 
nor gonadal alterations could be observed at 75 days.. Interestingly, 
they failed to cycle regularly at 5 mo whereas controls continued to 
cycle. On the other hand, the increase of EB exposure (Ei5, EI) resulted 
in a gradual and significant delay in the onset of first estrus and 
in a high number of estrous phases, as frequently observed during reproductive 
decline. At 75 days, the ovaries of these last two groups showed a reduced 
number of corpora lutea and an increased number of large follicles. 
According to this histological pattern, ovarian weight and <b>progesterone 
(P) content gradually decreased whereas both groups showed higher estradiol 
(E-2) content</b> than controls. This resulted in <b>a higher E-2:P 
ratio, comparable to that observed in normal aging rats.</b> The results 
allow us to conclude that the exposure time to large doses of estrogens 
is critical to the gradual enhancement of reproductive decline.  
Furthermore, exposures as brief as 24 h led to a potential early model 
for aging studies that will be useful to verify whether neuroendocrine 
changes precede gonadal impairment.</font> <br></p>

azaserine (30 mg/kg body weight) at 14 days of age. The rats were weaned 
to test diets formulated from purified ingredients. Dietary protein 
at 20% by weight was either casein or soy protein isolate (heat treated 
or raw).. Corn oil was the unsaturated fat of major interest and it 
was fed at either 5 or 20% by weight. Pancreases were quantitatively 
evaluated for carcinogen-induced lesions at 2- and 4-month postinitiation. 
In a second experiment designed to closely mimic the above experiment, 
rats were implanted with cannulae which allowed plasma to be repetitively 
sampled over a 2.5-week period during which the test diets were fed. 
Plasma was collected both prior to introduction of the test diets and 
afterwards. Plasma CCK was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. 
Both the 20% corn oil diet and the raw soy protein isolate diet enhanced 
pancreatic carcinogenesis. The effects of the raw soy protein isolate

than the effects of the 20% corn oil diet. Plasma CCK values were not 
elevated in the rats fed the 20% corn oil diet, but they were significantly 
elevated in the rats fed the raw soy protein isolate.  Heat-treated

plasma CCK level. This<b> study demonstrates that certain plant proteins 
enhance the growth of carcinogen-induced pancreatic foci and that this 
effect is considerably greater than the enhancement by high levels of

The mechanism by which a high fibre diet may reduce serum oestrogens

absorption from the colon so that changes in colonic transit-rate affect 
the proportion of oestrogen that is deconjugated and/or absorbed. AIM: 
To determine if alteration of intestinal transit rate would influence

loperamide. Plastic flakes had no effect on either oestrogen. Areas 
under the curve did not change significantly but tended to fall with 
the three transit-accelerating agents and to rise with loperamide. CONCLUSION: 
Our data indicate there is likely to be an effect of intestinal transit 
on the absorption of oestrogens but more refined techniques are needed 
to characterize this properly. </font></p>

Lower serum oestrogen concentrations associated with faster intestinal 
transit.</b>  Lewis SJ, Heaton KW, Oakey RE, McGarrigle HH University 
Department of Medicine, Bristol Royal Infirmary, UK. Increased fibre 
intake has been shown to reduce serum oestrogen concentrations. We hypothesized 
that fibre exerts this effect by decreasing the time available for reabsorption 
of oestrogens in the colon. We tested this in volunteers by measuring 
changes in serum oestrogen levels in response to manipulation of intestinal 
transit times with senna and loperamide, then comparing the results 
with changes caused by wheat bran. Forty healthy premenopausal volunteers 
were placed at random into one of three groups. The first group took 
senna for two menstrual cycles then, after a washout period, took wheat 
bran, again for two menstrual cycles. The second group did the reverse. 
The third group took loperamide for two menstrual cycles. At the beginning 
and end of each intervention a 4-day dietary record was kept and whole-gut 
transit time was measured; stools were taken for measurement of pH and 
beta-glucuronidase activity and blood for measurement of oestrone and 
oestradiol and their non-protein-bound fractions and of oestrone sulphate. <b>
Senna and loperamide caused the intended alterations in intestinal transit, 
whereas on wheat bran supplements there was a trend towards faster transit. 
Serum oestrone sulphate fell with wheat bran (mean intake 19.8 g day(-1)) 
and with senna; total- and non-protein-bound oestrone fell with senna.</b> 
No significant changes in serum oestrogens were seen with loperamide. 
No significant changes were seen in faecal beta-glucuronidase activity. 
Stool pH changed only with senna, in which case it fell. In conclusion, 
speeding up intestinal transit can lower serum oestrogen concentrations. </font> <br>

in female rats.</b> Arts CJ, de Bie AT, van den Berg H, van &#39;t Veer 
P, Bunnik GS, Thijssen JH TNO Toxicology and Nutrition Institute, The 
Netherlands.  In our animal experiments the hypothesis was tested 
that a high-fiber (HF) diet reduces tumor promotion<b> by interruption 
of the enterohepatic circulation resulting in lowered estrogen exposure 
of the estrogen-sensitive tissue. </b>

In the first experiment the development of N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU) 
induced mammary tumors was investigated. One group of rats (HF) was 
fed a HF diet (11% fiber, based on wheat bran), the other group (LF) 
fed a low-fiber diet (0.5% fiber, based on white wheat flour). Tumor 
incidence (90 and 80%, respectively) and latency (121 and 128 days, 
respectively) were similar in the HF and LF groups. Compared to the 
LF group, HF rats had lower tumor weights (0.16 vs 0.55 g; P less than 
0.01) and a slightly lower tumor multiplicity (1.8 vs 2.8 tumors per 
tumor-bearing rat). These differences were reduced after adjustment 
for body weight. In a second experiment rats, not treated with the carcinogen, 
were kept on the same HF and LF diets. From these rats 24-h urine and 
feces and orbital blood samples were<b> collected for analysis of (un)conjugated 
estrogens. The excretion of both free and conjugated estrogens in fecal 
samples was about 3-fold higher in HF rats than in LF rats. During the 
basal period of the cycle urinary excretion of estrone was lower in 
HF rats (mean 9.7 ng/day) than in LF rats (mean 13.0 ng/day; P less 
than 0.05). It is concluded that wheat bran interrupts the enterohepatic 
circulation of estrogens, but plasma levels are not affected. Whether 
the development of mammary tumors is reduced by the introduction of 
specific components of wheat bran, or by a reduced body weight due to 
a lower (effective) energy intake remains to be determined. </b></font></p>

Dietary lignin, and insoluble fiber, enhance uterine cancer but did

Birt DF, Markin RS, Blackwood D, Harvell DM, Shull JD, Pennington KL 
Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Disease, University

suggested potential breast cancer-preventive properties of dietary fiber 
from cabbage. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 
whether lignin, a component of cabbage fiber, would protect against 
mammary carcinogenesis by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in Sprague-Dawley 
rats. A six-week study was conducted using diets containing 0.5-5% dietary 
wood lignin (a readily available, purified source). These diets were 
well tolerated by the rats, and a carcinogenesis study using 5 mg MNU/100 
g body wt i.v. at 50 days of age was conducted, with the 2.5% lignin 
diet fed from 6 through 8 weeks of age followed by 5% lignin diet until 
20 weeks after MNU. Dietary lignin and MNU treatment increased food 
consumption (p &lt; 0.05), and body weight was slightly reduced at 10 
and 20 weeks after MNU in the MNU-5% lignin diet group (p &lt; 0.05). 
Serum estradiol was not altered by dietary lignin or MNU treatment, 
but uterine weights were highest in the MNU-control diet group 4 and 
12 weeks after MNU. Expression of creatine kinase B, an estrogen-responsive 
gene, was lower in the uteri of the MNU-lignin diet group than in other 
groups at 20 weeks. Mammary carcinogenesis was not altered by dietary 
lignin.<b> However, uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma was observed 
only in the MNU-lignin diet group (4 carcinomas/40 effective rats) (p

The in vitro addition of a green tea polyphenol mixture, a black tea

manner and their IC50 values for inhibition of estrogen metabolism were 
approximately 12.5, 50 and 10 microg/ml, respectively. Enzyme kinetic 
analysis indicates that the inhibition of estrone glucuronidation by 
10 microM (-)-epigallocatechin gallate was competitive while inhibition 
by 50 microM (-)-epigallocatechin gallate was noncompetitive. Similarly, 
several flavonoids (naringenin, hesperetin, kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, 
flavone, alpha-naphthoflavone and beta-naphthoflavone) also inhibited 
rat liver microsomal glucuronidation of estrone and estradiol to varying

on the activation of mutagens. Male mice (ddY) were given diets containing 
butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) or butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and 
flavone or flavanone (2,3-dihydroflavone) for two weeks and the ability 
of hepatic microsomes to activate aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene and N-nitrosodimethylamine

(0.1% BHT or 0.2% BHA in diet) and a flavonoid (0.1% flavone or 0.1% 
flavanone) <b>resulted in additive effects on the activation of aflatoxin

the mechanism for the additive effects, induction of specific isozymes

Co-administration of BHT (0.1%) and flavone (0.1%) increased markedly 
the levels of proteins and the activities of the enzymes related to 
the isozymes of CYP2A and CYP2B, while co-administration of BHA (0.2%)

by the induction of these isozymes. </font></p>
