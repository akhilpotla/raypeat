Vegetables, etc.—Who Defines Food?</b><br></font> 


<i><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Since bacteria in the rumens 
of cows destroy unsaturated fatty acids, but don't harm vitamin E, it 
seems reasonable to suppose that beef and milk would have a better ratio 
of vitamin E to unsaturated fats than do the plants eaten by the cows.</font> <br>
</p>
<p>   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Toxic pesticides 
are found in higher concentrations in the urine and fat of slaughtered 
animals than in their livers, since the livers are detoxifying the chemicals 
and causing them to be excreted. Presumably, the animals' livers will 
perform the same detoxification reactions with the <b>phytotoxicants 
that occur naturally in their diet.</b></font></p></i>


<hr width=75%>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Not 
long ago, breast feeding was socially unacceptable in the United States, 
and several manufacturers were teaching the world’s poorest women 
to use their baby-food formulas even when there was no clean water for 
its preparation. Industrialists have campaigned to convince the public 
that their by-products, from cotton-seed oil to shrimp shells, are “health 
foods.” In several parts of the world, desperately poor people sometimes 
eat clay, and even clay has been promoted as a health food. Almost anything 
becomes “food,” when people are under economic and social pressure. 
If these things aren’t acutely toxic, they can become part of our 
“normal” diet.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our 
instincts give us a few clues about our nutritional needs, such as thirst, 
the hunger for salt, the pleasantness of sweet things, and the unpleasantness 
of certain odors or very acrid or bitter tastes. People who are constitutionally 
unable to taste certain bitter chemicals find certain vegetables less 
objectionable; their instinctive guidance has become less clear.  
But within the boundaries of cravings and disgust, habits and customs 
become the dominant forces in diet. &quot;Professional dietitians&quot; 
and other &quot;experts&quot; primarily function as enforcers of cultural 
prejudice.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
manufacturers of pureed vegetables for babies used to put large amounts 
of salt, sugar, and monosodium glutamate into their products, because 
the added chemicals served as instinctual signals that made the material 
somewhat acceptable to the babies. There was no scientific basis for 
providing these vegetables to babies in a form that they would accept, 
but it was a profitable practice that was compatible with the social 
pressure against prolonged breast feeding.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Poor 
people, especially in the spring when other foods were scarce, have 
sometimes subsisted on foliage such as collard and poke greens, usually 
made more palatable by cooking them with flavorings, such as a little 
bacon grease and lots of salt. Eventually, &quot;famine foods&quot; 
can be accepted as dietary staples. The fact that cows, sheep, goats 
and deer can thrive on a diet of foliage shows that leaves contain essential 
nutrients. Their minerals, vitamins, and amino acids are suitable for 
sustaining most animal life, if a sufficient quantity is eaten. But 
when people try to live primarily on foliage, as in famines, they soon 
suffer from a great variety of diseases. Various leaves contain antimetabolic 
substances that prevent the assimilation of the nutrients, and only 
very specifically adapted digestive systems (or technologies) can overcome 
those toxic effects. </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some 
plants have specific “pests,” such as insects, that have adapted 
to be resistant to that plant’s toxins, but if the plant and its predator 
are to survive, there has to be a balance between the plant tissue’s 
digestibility and its toxicity. Injury of a plant stimulates it to make 
increased amounts of its defensive chemicals. Plant toxins are known 
to be specific for animal tissues; for example, a toxin will inhibit 
the action of an enzyme from an animal, but a plant enzyme that catalyzes 
the same reaction won’t be affected.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Plant 
defensive chemicals can have beneficial uses as drugs. Plants are important 
sources for chemicals used in chemotherapy of cancer, with the purpose 
of stopping cell division. Other plant drugs can stimulate cell division. 
The drug from one plant will sometimes protect cells against the toxic 
effects of another plant. The use of any drug that isn’t a natural 
part of animal physiology will have many biological effects, so that 
a beneficial drug action will usually be accompanied by unwanted side-effects. 
An antioxidant may turn out to disrupt the endocrine system, an antiinflammatory 
drug may be mutagenic or carcinogenic. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A 
particular plant will have a variety of defensive chemicals, with specific 
functions. Underground, the plant’s roots and tubers are susceptible 
to attack by fungi and nematodes. The leaves, stems, and seeds are susceptible 
to attack by insects, birds, and grazing animals. Since the plant’s 
seeds are of unique importance to the plant, and contain a high concentration 
of nutrients, they must have special protection. Sometimes this consists 
of a hard shell, and sometimes of chemicals that inhibit the animal’s 
digestive enzymes. Many plants have evolved fruits that provide concentrated 
food for animals, and that serve to distribute the seeds widely, as 
when a bird eats a berry, and excretes the undigested seed at a great 
distance. If the fruit were poisonous, it wouldn’t serve the plant’s 
purpose so well. In general, the plant’s most intense toxins are in 
its seeds, and the fruits, when mature, generally contain practically 
no toxins. Roots contain chemicals that inhibit microorganisms, but 
because they aren’t easily accessible by grazing animals and insects, 
they don’t contain the digestive inhibitors that are more concentrated 
in the </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">above-ground organs 
of the plant.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
toxins of plants include phenols, tannins, lectins/agglutinins, and 
trypsin-inhibitors, besides innumerable more specific metabolic inhibitors, 
including “anti-vitamins.” Unsaturated fats themselves are important 
defenses, since they inhibit trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes, 
preventing the assimilation of the proteins that are present in seeds 
and leaves, and disrupting all biological processes that depend on protein 
breakdown, such as the formation of thyroid hormone and the removal 
of blood clots.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Generally, 
fruits, roots, and tubers provide a high concentration of nutrients 
along with low concentrations of toxic antimetabolic substances. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">While 
nutritional reference tables often show fruits and potatoes as having 
about 2% protein content, while nuts, grains, and legumes are shown 
with a high protein content, often in the range of 15% to 40%, they 
neglect to point out that fruits and potatoes have a very high water 
content, while that of the seeds is extremely low. The protein content 
of milk is about 3%, which according to the charts would suggest that 
it is inferior to beans and grains. In fact, the protein value of grain 
is negligible, mainly because seeds contain their protein in a storage 
form, that is extremely rich in nitrogen, but poor in essential amino 
acids. Special preparation is needed to reduce the toxicity of seeds, 
and in the case of beans, these methods are never very satisfactory.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Besides 
their specific defensive toxins and antimetabolites, plants are major 
sources of allergens. The allergenicity of a food depends on the sensitivity 
of the individual, as well as on the growth conditions of the plant. 
The use of extremely toxic pesticides has affected both the crops and 
the sensitivity of the human population to allergens. Sensitivities 
induced originally by toxic pesticides used on certain crops can probably 
persist after the industrial chemical has been eliminated, because the 
immune system is susceptible to “conditioning.”</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Many 
types of phytochemicals are mutagenic, and some of those are carcinogenic. 
Bruce Ames, at the University of California, devised a method of screening 
for mutagens, using bacteria. One of his graduate students using the 
technique found that the flame retardants in children's pajamas and 
bedding were powerful mutagens, and were probably causing cancer. That 
event made Ames a celebrity, and in the 1980s he went on a lecture tour 
supported by the American Cancer Society. His lectures reflected the 
doctrine of the A.C.S., that industrial chemicals aren't responsible 
for cancer, but that individual actions, such as smoking or dietary 
choices, are the main causes of cancer. He used a fraudulently &quot;age 
adjusted&quot; graph of cancer mortality, that falsely showed that mortality 
from all types of cancer except lung cancer had leveled off after the 
A.C.S. came into existence. He described tests in which he had compared 
DDT to extracts of food herbs, and found DDT to be less mutagenic than 
several of the most commonly used flavoring herbs. His message, which 
was eagerly received by his audience of chemistry and biology professors, 
was that we should not worry about environmental pollution, because 
it's not as harmful as the things that we do to ourselves. He said that 
if everyone would eat more unsaturated vegetable oil, and didn't smoke, 
they wouldn't have anything to worry about. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For 
me, the significance of his experiment was that plants contain natural 
pesticides that should be taken more seriously, without taking industrial 
toxins less seriously.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Technologies 
have been invented to convert vegetation into digestible protein, but 
at our present scientific and technological level, it’s better to 
simply minimize our use of the more toxic foods, and to direct more 
effort toward the elimination of the conditions that produce famine.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Animal 
proteins, and fruits, because they contain the lowest levels of toxins, 
should form the basis of the diet. Not all fruits, of course, are perfectly 
safe--avocados, for example, contain so much unsaturated fat that they 
can be carcinogenic and hepatotoxic.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Protein 
deficiency itself contributes to the harm done by toxins, since the 
liver’s ability to detoxify them depends on adequate nutrition, especially 
good protein. In the 1940s, Biskind’s experiments showed that protein 
deficiency leads to the accumulation of estrogen, because the liver 
normally inactivates all the estrogen in the blood as it passes through 
the liver. This applies to phytoestrogens and industrial estrogens as 
well as to the natural estrogens of the body. At a certain point, the 
increased estrogen and decreased thyroid and progesterone cause infertility, 
but before that point is reached, the hyperestrogenism causes a great 
variety of birth defects. Deformities of the male genitals, and later, 
testicular cancer in the sons and breast cancer in the daughters, are 
produced by the combination of toxins and nutritional deficiencies. </font> <br>

Vivo 1998 Nov-Dec;12(6):675-89. <b>Comparative anticancer effects of 
vaccination and dietary factors on experimentally-induced cancers.</b> 
Zusman I Laboratory of Teratology and Experimental Oncology, </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, 
Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Quality Sciences, Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem, Rehovot, Israel. The role of two major factors 
were analyzed in the prevention of experimentally-induced cancers: a) 
vaccination of animals with polyclonal IgG generated against the soluble 
p53 antigen and b) feeding of animals with diets rich with dietary fibers 
or fat. a) In vaccination, a few attempts have been made to utilize 
p53 protein as a tumor suppressor. IgG generated against the cytoplasmic, 
soluble p53 antigen from tumor-bearing rats prevents the carcinogenic 
effect of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) decreasing significantly the number 
of tumor-bearing rats in vaccinated group compared with non vaccinated 
controls and preventing benign tumors from becoming malignant. The antitumor 
effect of vaccination is accompanied by a significant increase in the 
serum-level of p53 antigen in vaccinated rats compared with non vaccinated 
controls. The immune response of a host to vaccination activates the 
lymph components of the spleen, and this activation is manifested by 
the multiplication of the number of lymphocytes which are generated 
against specific antigens. This multiplication is achieved by the higher 
division of the antigen-specific lymphoblasts with their subsequent 
transformation into plasma cells. These cells synthesize the specific 
protein (IgG). One such protein is the tumor-associated p53 protein, 
which is synthesized by rats against rabbit anti-p53 IgG. b) The role 
of dietary factors in the prevention of chemically induced cancer was 
reviewed on two models: the role of high fiber diets in prevention of 
colon cancer, and <b>the role of high fat diets in the prevention of 
mammary gland cancer.</b> Experiments in colon cancer showed that 20% 
cellulose decreased significantly tumor incidence caused by DMH. The 
tumor-preventive effect of a cellulose diet was accompanied by increased 
enzyme concentrations, such as ornithine decarboxylase, thymidine kinase 
and beta-glucuronidase. This effect was accompanied by activation of 
some cellular mechanisms, i.e. apoptosis, proliferating cell nuclear 
antigen (PCNA) and p53 protein synthesis. <b>Experiments in mammary 
glands cancer showed that a 15% olive-oil diet reduced significantly 
the tumor incidence caused by 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracen<WBR>e. The 
antitumor effect of the olive-oil diet was connected to its content 
of monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic and 
palmitic acids. The promotive tumorigenic effects of other high-fat 
diets (avocado, soybeans) were associated with high content of some 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic and 
alpha-linolenic).</b> Different diets have different targets. The effect 
of the same diet depends on its anti-tumor substances content. CONCLUSIONS: 
Vaccination and some diets have similar mechanism in their tumor-preventive 
effects.</font></p>

composition of nearly 40 foods, currently consumed by 102 nursing Congolese 
mothers living in Brazzaville, were determined to assess their impact

wide variety of glycosides present in nature. We describe a stable cell-free 
extract of human feces, fecalase, which is shown to contain various 
glycosidases that allow the in vitro activation of many natural glycosides 
to mutagens in the Salmonella/liver homogenate test. Many beverages, 
such as red wine (but apparently not white wine) and tea, contain glycosides 
of the mutagne quercetin. Red wine, red grape juice, and tea were mutagenic 
in the test when fecalase was added, and red wine contained considerable 
direct mutagenic activity in the absence of fecalase. The implications 
of quercetin mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are discussed.</font></p>

assay, Micronucleus test and the check of the influence to HEp 2 and 
chinese hamster embryo (CHE) primary cultured cells. No evidence of 
mutagenicity of these samples were observed in Ames' test and Rec assay, 
while there was dose dependent increase of micronucleated cells and 
polychromatocytes on the bone marrow cells of mice and chinese hamsters 
treated with garlic juice. There were severe damages, e.g. growth inhibition 
and morphological changes of both cultured cells due to garlic juice, 
but no or slightly cytotoxic signs were observed even in high concentration 
of garlic extract. A higher sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of 
garlic was seen by the present findings with CHE primary cells than

6-n-propylthiouracil (Prop) has long been associated with enhanced sensitivity 
to other sweet and bitter compounds. New studies suggest that tasters 
and supertasters of Prop may also differ from 
notasters in their taste preferences and in their patterns of food rejection 
and food acceptance. One question is whether the acceptability of bitter-tasting 
vegetables is influenced by Prop taster status. 
Cruciferous vegetables are among the major dietary</b> sources of potentially 
chemoprotective agents in cancer control, and their consumption is reported 
to alter cancer risk. Strategies aimed at dietary change in individuals 
or groups should consider the role of genetic taste markers and their 
potential influences on food preferences and dietary habits.</font></p>

Dudka S, Miller WP University of Georgia, Department of Crop and Soil 
Sciences, Athens 30602-2727, USA. Contaminated soils can be a source 
for crop plants of such elements like As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. 
The excessive transfer of As, Cu, Ni, and Zn to the food chain is controlled 
by a &quot;soil-plant barrier&quot;; <b>however, for some elements, 
including Cd, the soil-plant barrier fails.</b> The level of Cd ingested 
by average person in USA is about 12 micrograms/day, which is relatively 
low comparing to Risk Reference Dose (70 micrograms Cd/day) established 
by USEPA. <b>Food of plant origin is a main source of 
Cd intake by modern society.</b> Fish and shellfish may be a dominant 
dietary sources of Hg for some human populations. <b>About half of human 
Pb intake is through food, of which more than half originates from plants.</b> 

Dietary intake of Cd and Pb may be increased by application of sludges 
on cropland with already high levels of these metals. Soils amended 
with sludges in the USA <b>will be permitted (by 
USEPA-503 regulations) to accumulate 
Cr, Cd, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni, and Se, and 
Zn to levels from 10 to 100 times the present baseline concentrations.</b> 
These levels are very permissive by international standards. Because 
of the limited supply of toxicity data obtained from metals applied 
in sewage sludge, predictions as to the new regulations will protect 
crop plants from metal toxicities, and food chain from contamination, 
are difficult to make.</font></p>

is associated with hypospadias. The 
ALSPAC Study Team. Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood.</b> 
North K, Golding J Unit of Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology, Division 
of Child Health, University of Bristol, UK. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 
the possible role of the maternal diet, particularly vegetarianism and 
consumption of phytoestrogens, in the origin of hypospadias, which is 
reported to be increasing in prevalence. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Detailed 
information was obtained prospectively from mothers, including previous 
obstetric history, lifestyle and dietary practices, using structured 
self-completed questionnaires during pregnancy. Previously recognized 
associations with environmental and parental factors were examined, 
focusing particularly on the hypothesized hormonal link. Multivariate 
logistic regression was used to identify independent associations. RESULTS: 
Of 7928 boys born to mothers taking part in the Avon Longitudinal Study 
of Pregnancy and Childhood, 51 hypospadias cases were identified. There 
were no significant differences in the proportion of hypospadias cases 
among mothers who smoked, consumed alcohol or for any aspect of their 
previous reproductive history (including the number of previous pregnancies, 
number of miscarriages, use of the contraceptive pill, time to conception 
and age at menarche). <b>Significant differences were detected for some 
aspects of the maternal diet, i.e. vegetarianism and iron 
supplementation in the first half of pregnancy. Mothers who were vegetarian 
in pregnancy had an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 4.99 (95% confidence 
interval, CI, 2.10-11.88) of giving birth to a boy with 
hypospadias, compared with omnivores who did not supplement their diet 
with iron. Omnivores who supplemented their diet with iron had an adjusted 
OR of 2.07 (</b>95% CI, 1.00-4.32). The only other statistically significant 
association for hypospadias was with influenza in the first 3 months 
of pregnancy (adjusted OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.50-6.78). CONCLUSION: As vegetarians 
have a greater exposure to phytoestrogens than do omnivores, these results 
support the possibility that phytoestrogens have a deleterious effect 
on the developing male reproductive system.</font> </p>
