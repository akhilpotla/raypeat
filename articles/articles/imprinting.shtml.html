============================<WBR>==== <br>
                              <WBR>    IN OUTLINE: <br>
Stresses, including estrogen excess, activate the Heat Shock Proteins 
(HSP), the stress-proteins, a primitive defense system. <br>

Heat Shock Proteins and &quot;hormone receptors&quot; are closely related 
and interdependent. <br>
Stress (at least partly via HSP) activates viral expression, ordinary 
gene expression, and destabilizes the genome, activating the &quot;endonucleases,&quot; 
enzymes which break up DNA chains.   <br>
Stress increases genetic variability. <br>
DNA chains can be chemically modified (e.g., methylated) in a way that 
limits enzymes&#39; accesss, probably as protection, and to regulate gene 
expression. <br>
Genes, and subsequent growth and development, are modified by the prenatal 
hormonal environment, that of the newborn, and even that of the parents 
before conception. <br>

<i>Genomic imprinting</i> makes maternal genes behave differently from 
paternal genes. <br>
<i>Hormonal imprinting</i> early in life sets the pattern of expression 
of genes. <br>
&quot;Crossing-over&quot; intermixes the genes on the chromosomes as 
cells multiply. <br>
Stresses and regulatory substances can change the patterns of gene expression 
that define cell types. <br>
&quot;Stem cells&quot; are those capable of renewing tissues, and may 
be &quot;pluripotent,&quot; able to become glial cells and neurons in 
the brain, or, in the bone marrow, to become red blood cells or white 
blood cells, depending on regulatory influences. <br>

&quot;Cloning&quot; animals from body cells strongly suggests that any 
cell is potentially totipotent, able to differentiate into any other 
type of cell. <br>
We are &quot;imprinted&quot; by our mothers&#39; hormonal and nutritional 
conditions, but we can intervene to correct these &quot;inherited&quot; 
conditions, by maintaining optimal hormonal and nutritional balances. <br>
                              <WBR>   ===========================<WBR>===== <br>

 <br>
Recent work in several areas of biology is showing that heredity is 
not rigidly deterministic, in the way implied by traditional genetics, 
and it is opening the way for the development of therapies for incurable, 
chronic, or congenital problems, <i>in natural and holistic ways that 
don&#39;t involve the mechanistic interventions of &quot;gene therapy&quot; 
or &quot;genetic engineering.&quot; </i> For example, nontoxic treatments 
for cancer that were demonstrated decades ago, were discarded because 
they didn&#39;t seem consistent with &quot;genetics.&quot;  Many problems 
that are classified as congenital or genetic, turn out to be physiological, 
and correctable.  Even the brain and the heart, which until recently 
were considered to be incapable of regenerative repair, are now seen 
to be capable of great anatomical flexibility.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>

There are still great authoritarian forces opposed to recognizing, and 
supporting, the organism&#39;s full potential.  <b>The most useful therapies 
will remain in obscurity until many people see that those therapies 
have a firmer scientific foundation than orthodox (antiquated) medical 
genetics has. <br>
 <br>
</b>Over 100 years ago, Samuel Butler had an argument with Charles Darwin, 
and concluded that Darwin was philosophically muddled, and dishonest.  
Butler was annoyed that Darwin had belittled the work of his predecessors, 
including his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin.  Butler was defending the 
idea of biological intelligence, the incorporation of experience into 
physiology and heredity.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
My parents had an old copy of  one of Darwin&#39;s books, and I was impressed 
by the fact that in his introduction, Darwin was careful to point out 
that <i>his ideas were already being misrepresented, and that he did 
not hold &quot;natural selection&quot; to be the only mechanism of evolution,</i> 

but that several factors were important, including sexual selection 
and the inheritance of acquired traits.  I suppose those remarks might 
have been motivated partly by knowing that Butler didn&#39;t approve of 
the way he was behaving, but they didn&#39;t seem to have much influence 
on the way history has characterized Darwin&#39;s work.  All of my biology 
professors would have been happier if Darwin had never made those remarks.  
I suspect that Darwin&#39;s problem was that <i>any theory of evolution </i>
was under such heavy attack that he couldn&#39;t devote much time to the 
relatively minor issue of how evolution works. <br>
After Darwin&#39;s death, the study of heredity made some strange concessions 
to the culture of anti-evolutionism.  As people began thinking about 
&quot;particles that carry heredity,&quot; the &quot;genes,&quot; ideas 
from the anti-evolutionist culture formed much of the context for understanding 
these &quot;particles.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
Darwin had suggested that the mature organism reconstitutes itself in 
the germ cells, by sending gemmules or pangens (buds or sprouts or derivatives) 
from its various parts, so that the parent&#39;s traits would be incorporated 
into the reproductive cells.  This was called pangenesis, meaning that 
the whole organism was the source for the new offspring.  This theory 
opened the possibility for newly acquired traits to be passed on.  It 
grew out of the experience of animal breeders and horticulturists, who 
were dedicated to improving their breeds and strains, <i>by selecting 
the best individuals grown under the best conditions. </i> It was known 
that the miniature ponies, <b>Shetlands for example, would grow larger 
each generation when bred under favorable conditions of domestication, 
rather than under the harsh conditions of their native island.  </b> It 
apparently never occurred to most plant and animal breeders that they 
might be able to <i>improve</i> a breed by subjecting it to harmful 
conditions. <br>
Around the end of the 19th century, August Weismann began a systematic 
attack on the ideas of Darwin.  As part of his campaign, he invented 
the doctrine that the reproductive cells are absolutely isolated from 
the rest of the organism, and that they are immortal.  The rest of the 
organism is built up by the <i>deletion</i> of genetic information.  
This doctrine was very convenient for those who maintained that all 
organisms had been created in a single moment, and that the <i>appearance</i> 

of evolution resulted from the extinction of some species, but not the 
new appearance of some species.  Some people, reasoning from Weismannism, 
suggested that evolution might have resulted without any change in the 
immortal genetic material, except deletion, in a manner analogous to 
Weismann&#39;s theory of the developing individual.  Bacteria, in that view, 
would contain all the genes needed to make a tree or a person, and the 
more complex forms would have evolved through the differential loss 
of that primeval genetic information.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
The changes produced by <i>subtraction</i> were compatible with the 
notion of fallen man in a corrupt world, while the <i>addition</i> of 
heritable traits through experience would connote a sharing in the process 
of creation.  The hereditary particles making up Weismann&#39;s &quot;immortal 
isolated germ line&quot; connoted a single original creation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
As mutations in the genes came to be seen as a reality, experiments 
with X-rays suggested to some that all mutations were harmful, and this 
attitude blended into the stream of doctrine which insisted that no <i>
improvement</i> could be inherited.  Although many experiments showed 
what seemed to be meaningfully <i>directed</i> mutations, the doctrine 
held its ground, as its advocates taught that mutations were always 
random.  (The doctrine of random change, like the idea that entropy only 
increases, excluded acts of creation from the fallen material world.)   
If a new trait appeared under new conditions, it was said to be <i>only 
because an old trait was being revealed by the induced loss</i> of another 
trait.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
I think anyone who reads the &quot;landmark publications&quot; in genetics 
will see that genetics had very little to do with scientific method, 
as commonly conceived, and that it had all the traits of a cult.  Analysis 
of the language of genetics reveals that terms have more often been 
used to cover up empty speculation than to clarify situations of fact.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
Parallel to the way Darwin infuriated Samuel Butler by misrepresenting 
the origins of his theory, the neodarwinists who debate the creationists 
over school textbooks are ignoring the ways in which the culture of 
antievolutionism shaped their own view of genetics. <br>
 <br>
The discovery of enzymes that produce DNA modeled on RNA, &quot;reverse 
transcriptases,&quot; began undermining traditional genetics, because 
it showed that new information can enter our genome. <br>
The discovery that bacteria can pass &quot;genes&quot; from one individual 
to another, conferring antibiotic resistance upon previously sensitive 
strains, was a major nuisance to people working in infectious disease, 
since it complicates the treating of disease, but it indicated that 
&quot;evolution,&quot; or genetic change, was capable of happening in 
non-random ways. <br>

   <br>
Early in the study of viral genetics, many people realized that &quot;organisms&quot; 
which can&#39;t reproduce without their relatively complex hosts, presented 
a problem for evolutionary theory.  If the virus requires a cell in order 
to exist, it is hardly a separate organism.  A few people suggested that 
viruses were, or were based on, functional normal parts of higher organisms.  
Some researchers have suggested that virus-like particles serve to carry 
information from one part of an organism to other parts of that organism.  
Mobile genetic elements are now well recognized, operating within cells, 
and it is common laboratory practice to use viral particles to transfer 
genetic material from one cell to another.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
Cellular systems which cut and splice nucleic acids, creating sequences 
of information which don&#39;t exist in the inherited chromosomes, are now 
accepted parts of cell biology.  Hormonal and environmental influences 
on the stability of messenger RNA, and on mobile genetic elements, and 
on genomic stability in general, are recognized.  <b><i>The center of 
gravity in the study of the nucleic acids has now shifted from heredity 
to development. <br>
 <br>
</i>Almost nothing remains of Weismannism, which was the foundation 
of neodarwinism.  The &quot;isolation of the germline&quot; doctrine 
persists in a few places, such as explaining why &quot;the ovary runs 
out of eggs,&quot; despite some examples of egg-cell renewal.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b> <br>
But when the identity of &quot;germline cells&quot; is found to depend 
on signals from the environment, the last vestige of Weismannian germ-line 
doctrine disappears.</b> The only meaning of &quot;germline&quot; is 
that some cells are destined to be germ cells, and the meaning disappears 
when such cells differentiate to form body parts. (see Donovan, 1998, 
Labosky, et al., 1994.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
The difference between primordial germ cells and embryonic cells is 
a matter of &quot;imprinting,&quot; the process in which a hormone or 

&quot;growth factor&quot; or other &quot;signal&quot; directs a cell 
down a certain course of differentiation.  &quot;Imprinting&quot; is 
where genetics and physiology, phylogeny and ontoneny, come together, 
and the new facts that are being discovered are removing the last vestige 
of scientific content from Weismannism/neodarwinism.  <br>
 <br>
The argument between Peter Duesberg and the virus establishment, in 
which Duesberg argues that acquired immunodeficiency is produced by 
a variety of causes, including drug use, and the establishment argues 
that the HIV retrovirus is the only cause, becomes a little clearer 
when we consider it in the context of the larger debate between the 
genetic determinists and the Darwinian adaptationists.  I will talk about 
that in more detail in a newsletter on immunodeficiency.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
The issues of cancer, aging, and &quot;hormone receptors,&quot; are 
also illuminated by seeing the organism as capable of adaptive modification 
of its genes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
These newer molecular approaches to the study of biology are vindicating 
some of the practical observations of plant and animal breeders, and 
terms such as <i>telegony, heterosis,</i> and <i>xenia</i> might come 
into common use again, along with <i>genomic imprinting. <br>
 <br>
</i>Here, I want to give examples of &quot;hormonal imprinting&quot; 
amd &quot;genetic imprinting,&quot; and to show how the idea of the 

&quot;retrovirus&quot; or &quot;mobile genetic elements&quot; relates 
to practical health issues and therapies.  The developing egg cell is 
constructed and modified in many ways during its growth.  The nurse cells 
which surround it in the ovarian follicle inject massive quantities 
of material, especially RNA, into the expanding egg cell.  Regulatory 
substances and energy production modify enzyme activities and structural 
proteins, which will influence the way it develops after fertilization.  
During the entire lifetime of the individual person, the developing 
egg cells are open to influences from the organism as a whole.  Because 
of the Weismannian scientific culture, it&#39;s important to start with 
a few of the clearest interaction between the environment and the reproductive 
cell, but many other types of interaction are starting to be explored. <br>
 <br>
It has been suggested that environmental stress is responsible for viral 
epidemics, by activating viruses in their animal hosts, and causing 
them to spread to humans.  Whether that&#39;s true or not, it is well recognized 
that stress causes increased susceptibility to the development of viral 
infections.  It also causes increased genetic variability, which is logical 
in the evolutionary sense, that a species should become more variable 
when its environmental niche has changed.  The mobile genetic elements 
that were first recognized by Barbara McClintock are now considered 
to be the most important means by which stress increases genetic variability. <br>
 <br>
In bacteria (J. Cairns<b>;</b> Salyers &amp; Shoemaker, 1996), genetic 
changes are known to occur in response to specific substances, which 
lead to adaptation to that substance. The mobile elements which are 
responsible for the defensive adaptive response to antibiotics are similar 
to viruses.  <b>In these instances, the genetic dogma which has been 
taught very recently in the universities couldn&#39;t have been more clearly 
disproved.  So far, the tendency in the United States is to concentrate 
on the details because of their technological potential (for genetic 
engineering of lucrative products) and to ignore the larger biological 
meaning of this interaction of stress with genetics. </b> </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
Resistance to antibiotics is transmitted to other bacteria by &quot;injecting,&quot; 
during conjugation of a resistant bacterium with a sensitive one, a 
small virus-like granule containing the DNA required for detoxifying 
the antibiotic, along with some adjoining genes.  The antibiotic itself, 
producing stress, stimulates the formation of this genetic package.  
(Whole university courses used to be devoted to showing why such things 
couldn&#39;t happen.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
The enzymes which cut out sections of DNA are the &quot;restrictases,&quot; 
which are famous for their use in identifying samples of DNA.  These 
&quot;endonucleases&quot; are activated by stress.  In &quot;excitotoxicity,&quot; 

which kills nerve cells through a combination of intense activation 
with deficient energy stores (i.e., stress), these enzymes are activated. <br>
In apoptosis, or &quot;programmed cell death,&quot; these enzymes are 
activated, along with enzymes which repair the broken genes, and the 
resulting energy drain from an impossible repair job causes the cell&#39;s 
sudden dissolution.  Between excitotoxicity and apoptosis, there are 
intermediate states, in which the dissolution is retarded or reversed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
When the stress is more generalized, so that the cells survive, the 
more sensitive sections of DNA are rearranged within the cell.  Some 
of them may escape as infective particles.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
Barbara McClintock wrote about the effects of stress causing genetic 
rearrangement, and traced the movements of the mobile genetic elements.  
At the same time, without knowing about her work, Leonell Strong was 
working with mice, exploring the role of &quot;genetic instability&quot; 

in causing cancer, and identifying estrogen and &quot;milk particle,&quot; 
or &quot;milk factor,&quot; a virus-like particle that interacted with 
estrogen, as causes of breast cancer. <br>
With only the elements of <i>stress,</i> the <i>endonucleases,</i> and 
the <i>mobile packets of genes,</i> adaptively increased variability, 
and the spreading of genes among a population can be explained.  However, 
there is a subtler level at which the adaptations acquired by an indiviual 
can be passed on to offspring.  This is &quot;imprinting.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
&quot;Genetic imprinting&quot; is being studied mainly in terms of the 
covering of regions of DNA with methyl groups.  This is thought to have 
evolved as a way to keep the endonucleases from attacking the DNA.  Sections 
of DNA that have been methylated can be passed on to offspring in that 
form, and they can be traced as a pattern of gene activity or inactivity.  
The maternal genes function in a manner identifiably different from 
the paternal genes.  Having passed through the mother&#39;s body, the genes 
have been modified.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
&quot;Hormonal imprinting&quot; refers to the great changes in sensitivity 
to hormones (and related substances) that persist after exposure to 
that substance early in life.  When the mother&#39;s hormones are imbalanced 
during pregnancy or nursing, the baby is &quot;imprinted&quot; with 
an altered sensitivity to hormones.  Leonell Strong showed that these 
effects could be exaggerated generation after generation.  But--strangely, 
considering that he was a student of T. H. Morgan, who is considered 
to be the founder of classical genetics--<b> Strong</b> <b>found that 
a single treatment, or a series of treatments, with an extract of liver, 
or with certain nucleosides (the units for constructing DNA), could 
reverse the course of generations of breeding, and eliminate the susceptibility 
to cancer.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b> <br>
</b>In modern terms, he was probably working with a combination of genetic 
imprinting and hormonal imprinting.  His &quot;milk factor&quot; very 
probably was one of the &quot;endogenous retroviruses,&quot; or mobile 
genetic elements.  (However, Gaal, et al., 1998, found that imprinting 
factors can be transmitted in the milk.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
Movable genetic elements appear to regulate normal developmental processes 
(Long, et al., 1998) and the introduction of new particles can &quot;improve 
fitness.&quot;  This is an aspect of the HIV controversy that has been 
completely ignored, as far as I can tell.  Peter Duesberg argues that 
the presence of antibodies to the HIV indicates that the immune system 
is active, and that there is no evidence showing the virus to be harmful.  
My suggestion would be that the virus is probably present quietly in 
many people who have no antibodies to it, and that environmental toxins 
and other stressors cause it to be adaptively expressed, creating the 
possibility for an antibody response.  The &quot;viral particle&quot; 

itself might be biologically useful, though this wouldn&#39;t exclude the 
possibility that an abnormal immunological response to it could have 
harmful repercussions. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
The importance of the retroviruses in the human genome hasn&#39;t been widely 
appreciated. (&quot;almost 10%<b> . . .</b> homology with the retroviruses,&quot; 
Deb, et al, 1998.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>

Environmental pollution with estrogens and immunosuppressive substances, 
when it persists throughout the developmental period, and across generations, 
will be dangerous at levels much below those that show an immediate 
hormonal or immunosuppressive effect.  Tests that determine the &quot;mutagenicity&quot; 
or &quot;carcinogenicity&quot; of a substance are performed within a 
context of a theoretical genetics which is demonstrably false<b>;</b> 
until the complexities of imprinting and transgenerational effects are 
taken into account, it would be wrong to accept the claim that there 
are &quot;safe levels,&quot; or &quot;thresholds of harmful effects.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>

When babies are imprinted by the mother&#39;s diuretics, by milk substitutes, 
and by industrial effluents, the worst effects are likely to be seen 
decades later, or even generations later. <br>
 <br>
There is a simple image that I think makes it possible to grasp as a 
whole the unity of things which have been described as existing on different 
&quot;levels,&quot; the genetic, the metabolic, and the ecological.  
This is the image of an interaction between water and large molecules, 
such as proteins and nucleic acids, with the system--the way the large 
molecule is folded, and the way the water molecules are ordered--having 
more than one arrangement, or physical state, each state differing slightly 
in the amount of potential energy it contains.  Then, the differences 
between respiratory energy (producing carbon dioxide and consuming electron-equivalents), 
and relatively anaerobic conditions, determine the probability that 
the system will return to its higher energy state after it has been 
perturbed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
A brief perturbation amounts to simple perception and response, reflecting 
the basic &quot;irritability&quot; of life, to use Lamarck&#39;s term.  But 
with more intense disturbances, the structures are altered at deeper 
levels, and structures will be restored with different degrees of completeness, 
and the organism will have adapted, according to its resources, either 
toward increased &quot;fitness&quot; and sensitivity, or toward decreased 
sensitivity.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
On the level of an individual, the movement away from fitness and sensitivity 
would resemble the development of aging and degenerative disease<b>; </b>
on the level of a species, it would amount to &quot;reverse evolution,&quot; 
a mammal would become more reptilian, a primate would become more rodent-like.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <br>
Protective interventions, and therapies, will consist of things which 
protect the structures (preserving sensitivity, while blocking excessive 
stimulation), and which increase the energy resources.  A great variety 
of physiological indicators show that substances such as progesterone, 
thyroid and carbon dioxide are acting &quot;universally&quot; as protectants, 
in ways that make sense only with some perspective such as this, of 
the systematic changes in the physical state of the living substance. <br>

Sundstrom L. &quot;Site-specific recombination of integrons, mediates 
transfer of single genes in small genomes and plasmids. Recent data 
suggest that new genes are recruited to the cassettes--the units moved 
by integrons. Integrons are resident in a class of transposons with 
pronounced target selectivity for resolution loci in<b> broad host range 
plasmids. A resulting network of programmed transfer routes, with potential 
offshoots reaching into eukaryotic cells, may channel genes to unexpectedly 
remote organisms.&quot; </b>&quot;It seems very clear that integrons 
and associated programmed transfer mechanisms have high significance 
for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria whereas 
further studies are needed to assess their importance for spreading 
of arbitrary genes <b>in a wider range of host systems.&quot;</b> </font></p>
