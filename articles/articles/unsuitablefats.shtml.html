Suitable 
Fats, Unsuitable Fats: Issues in Nutrition</b><br></font><br> 
<font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">




<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">For 
fifty years, the mass media have been making the public think about 
the fats in their diet, filling the culture with clichés about bad 
saturated animal fats that raise cholesterol, or lately the trans-fats 
in margarine, and images of arteries clogged by bad fats. The public 
instruction about the fats we should eat resembles the owner&#39;s manual 
for a car, that tells you what kind of motor oil and fuel and coolant 
to use; they are telling us that they know how our body works, and that 
they know what it needs. But now, even after the human genome has supposedly 
been partly &quot;decoded,&quot; the biological functions of the fats 
have hardly begun to be investigated.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">To 
understand the present issues regarding fats in nutrition and medicine 
it&#39;s helpful to look at the historical development of biochemical and 
physiological fat research in a variety of contexts, including agriculture 
and economics, as well as considering the effects of the changing ideas 
about cell structure, vitamins, hormones, immunology, brain development, 
evolution, and the growing understanding of the way physiology interacts 
with ecology. We need to recognize the complexity of the physiology 
of fats, to appreciate the complexity of the living organism. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Financial 
considerations have driven fat research in very obvious ways. In 1883, 
Mark Twain described how commercial fraud was making use of new technology 
to substitute cheap fats and oils for butter and olive oil.. Hard fats 
such as tallow, which had been used for making soap and candles, began 
to be widely used as a substitute for butter in the 19th century. Around 
1912, chemists found economical ways to solidify (for use as a butter 
substitute) the very cheap liquid oils, such as cottonseed oil, linseed 
oil, whale oil, and fish oils, which been used mostly as fuels or varnish. 
The seed oils were so cheap that meat packers quickly became major producers 
of hydrogenated cottonseed and soy oils, to extend their limited supply 
of lard or tallow for sale as shortening or margarine.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Between 
1912 and 1927 there were several studies that reported that animals 
could live on a fat-free diet, and that in fact they lived longer, and 
without the normal mortality from cancer. In the 1940s and 1950s, most 
textbooks that mentioned the idea that certain fats were essential nutrients 
described it as a controversial idea. But the oil industries used public 
relations effectively to sell the medical (heart protective) benefits 
of a diet containing increased amounts of linoleic and linolenic acids, 
which they called the essential fatty acids. They began citing a 1929 
publication (by G. Burr and M. Burr) that claimed to demonstrate the 
essentiality of those fatty acids, while ignoring the publications that 
pointed in different directions.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
cheapness of the seed oils led to their use in animal feeds, to promote 
growth. By the 1940s, the polyunsaturated oils, including fish oils, 
were known to cause deterioration of the brain, muscles, and gonads 
in a variety of animals, and this was found to be caused mainly by their 
destruction of vitamin E. A little later, the disease called steatitis 
or yellow fat disease was found to be produced in various animals that 
were fed too much fish or fish oil. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
reason linseed oil and fish oil were used for making varnishes and paints 
was that they are &quot;drying oils,&quot; reacting with oxygen to polymerize 
and harden. The physical and chemical propertiess of the oils are fairly 
well understood, and among the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) the 
omega -3 fatty acids react most easily with oxygen. Heat, light, and 
moisture increase their spontaneous interactions with oxygen, and besides 
polymerizing, these oils produce a variety of reactive particles, including 
acrolein, which combine with other substances, such as cellular proteins 
and DNA, with highly toxic effects. At low temperatures and low oxygen 
concentrations these oils are not highly reactive. Fats that harden 
at low temperatures (as saturated fats do) wouldn&#39;t be convenient for 
organisms that live in a cool environment, and so organisms regulate 
the type of fat they synthesize according to the temperature of their 
tissues. The fact that certain types of polyunsaturated fatty acids 
function nicely in fish, worms, and insects, doesn&#39;t mean that they 
are ideal fats for mammals.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
fact that vitamin E prevented or cured some of the major diseases in 
farm animals caused by excessive PUFA, and that it could retard the 
development of rancidity in stored oils, led quickly to the persistent 
belief that lipid peroxidation is the only toxic effect of the vegetable 
oils. However, the oils were being seen to cause other problems, including 
accelerated aging and obesity, but those problems weren&#39;t of interest 
to farmers, who wanted to sell plump young animals as cheaply and quickly 
as possible. Even fresh oils have toxic effects, and the oxidative damage 
they do is often the consequence of these other toxic actions.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Another 
cheap food additive, coconut oil, was found to increase feed consumption 
while slowing weight gain, so it wasn&#39;t popular in the meat industry. 
The highly unsaturated seed oils had the opposite effect, of producing 
a rapid fattening of the animal, while decreasing feed consumption, 
so by 1950 corn and soybeans were widely considered to be optimal feeds 
for maximizing profits in the production of meat animals. It was at 
this time that the industry found that it could market the liquid oils 
directly to consumers, as health-promoting foods, without bothering 
to turn them into solid shortening or margarine. Somehow, few physiologists 
continued to think about the implications of metabolic slowing, obesity, 
and the related degenerative diseases.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">As 
vitamin research advanced in the 1940s, Roger Williams&#39; lab at the Clayton 
Foundation Biochemical Institute, University of Texas at Austin, recognized 
the &quot;fat deficiency disease&quot; of the Burrs as a deficiency 
of vitamin B6, and showed that when they produced the condition with 
a diet similar to the one the Burrs had used, they could cure it by 
administering vitamin B6. In the early 1930s George Burr had discovered 
that animals on a fat free diet had an extremely high rate of metabolism, 
but he didn&#39;t investigate the important ramifications of that observation, 
such as their increased need for vitamins and minerals, in accordance 
with their rate of metabolism. The PUFA slowed metabolism, and that 
effect was good for agriculture.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
commercial pressure on fat research has created a new way of writing 
research reports, that several decades earlier wouldn&#39;t have been acceptable. 
For example, the effects of a specific fat on a few of the components 
of a complex process such as clotting are often described in the title, 
introduction, and conclusion of an article as if they were revealing 
a way to prevent heart disease. The effects of unsaturated fats on cells <i>
in vitro</i> are often the opposite of their effects in living animals, 
but editors are allowing authors to claim that their <i>in vitro</i> 
results justify dietary or therapeutic use of the fats. Journals of 
medicine and nutrition are now preferred sites for commercial press 
releases, composed to superficially resemble scientific reports.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
suppressive effects of unsaturated fats on mitochondrial energy production 
have been widely investigated, since it is that effect that makes animal 
fattening with PUFA so economical. Rather than interpreting that as 
a toxic effect, using the innate structure and function of the mitochondrion 
as a point of reference from which to evaluate dietary components, the 
consumption of &quot;good&quot; oils is being used as the reference 
point from which to evaluate the meaning of metabolism (&quot;efficiency 
is good,&quot; &quot;low oxygen consumption is good&quot;). Building 
on the idea that the oils are health-promoters which increase metabolic 
efficiency, the never-viable &quot;rate of aging&quot; theory was resuscitated: 
The anti-respiratory effect of PUFA is used (illogically) to return 
to the idea that aging occurs in proportion to the amount of oxygen 
consumed, because animals which lack the supposedly essential nutrients 
(&quot;defective animals&quot;) consume oxygen rapidly--burning calories 
rapidly, they are supposed to be like a candle that won&#39;t last as long 
if it burns intensely. The old theory is simply resuscitated to explain 
why the anti-respiratory action of PUFA might be beneficial, justifying 
further promotion of their use as food and drugs.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Ordinarily, 
in biochemistry and physiology the inhibition of an enzyme is taken 
as a suggestion of toxicity, but when the point of reference is the 
idea of the goodness of PUFA, the <i>activity</i> of an intrinsic enzyme 
is taken to be evidence of harm, and its <i>inhibition</i> (by PUFA) 
is taken to be the proper, healthful situation. The enzyme that produces 
the Mead fatty acid is strongly inhibited by PUFA seed oils (less strongly 
by fish oils), and so the presence of the Mead acid in the tissues is 
taken as evidence that the animal is suffering damage resulting from 
the absence of PUFA. The Mead acid happens to have some valuable anti-inflammatory 
effects, and is associated with many biological advantages, but research 
in that direction is prevented by the lack of funding.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">By 
1920, the polyunsaturated fatty acids were recognized to inhibit proteolytic 
enzymes. At that time, the production of unsaturated fat was considered 
to be a feature of certain pathogens, able to overcome the proteolytic-phagocytic 
functions of the immune system. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Scattered 
studies have found that polyunsaturated fats inhibit the proteolytic 
enzymes involved in the digestion of food, in the removal of clots, 
in the formation of thyroid hormone, and many other essential physiological 
processes. But currently, the only implication being drawn from this 
broad class of effects of the PUFA is that some proteolytic enzymes 
are involved in disease processes, and consequently increased consumption 
of PUFA would be appropriate, because of their ability to suppress a 
conditionally harmful proteolytic enzyme. Since the organism consists 
mainly of proteins, there are complex innate systems for regulating 
the proteolytic enzymes, activating or inactivating them as needed, 
and such complexity isn&#39;t likely to depend on variable, unstable dietary 
factors. Exogenous substances that inhibit some proteases could create 
an unlimited variety of functional and anatomical irregularities.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Some 
of the interesting enzymes affected specifically by polyunsaturated 
fatty acids are those involved in hormone production. While they inhibit 
the formation of progesterone and androgens, they activate the synthesis 
of estrogen, which in turn activates the release of more free polyunsaturated 
fatty acids from the tissues, in a positive feedback pattern.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
inhibition of detoxification enzymes by PUFA (Tsoutsikos, et al., 2004) 
affects many processes, such as the elimination of estrogen, contributing 
to the positive feedback between estrogen and the oils. The meaning 
of this tends to be lost, because of the estrogen industry&#39;s effective 
campaigns.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Another 
situation in which fatty acids participate in a positive feedback system 
is the stress reaction, in which the released fatty acids impair mitochondrial 
energy production, increasing the stress and leading to further release 
of fatty acids.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">One 
of the perennial theories of aging that has remained viable is the metaplasm/lipofuscin/age 
pigment theory, the idea that a toxic material accumulates in tissues 
over time. The age pigment contains proteins, cross-linked PUFA, and 
metals. The inhibition of proteolytic enzymes is involved in its accumulation, 
and the ratio of PUFA to saturated fatty acids is an important factor 
in its formation. Estrogen is one of the factors that can promote the 
formation of age pigment, probably partly because its lipolytic action 
increases the cells&#39; exposure to free fatty acids. The lipofuscin contributes 
to inhibition of proteolysis, probably partly through increased production 
of free radicals and hydrogen peroxide.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
proteolytic enzymes are an essential part of innate immunity, and the 
highly unsaturated fatty acid, EPA, which is the most immunosuppressive 
of the fats, strongly inhibits proteolysis in some cells. The natural 
killer (NK) cells and phagocytic cells are two types of cell that are 
suppressed by PUFA, and they are involved in many kinds of physiological 
events, not just the killing of tumor cells and virus infected cells.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
immunosuppressive effects of PUFA are very general. Many metabolites 
that are known to have harmful effects on the immune system are increased 
by the PUFA (histamine [Masini, et al., 1990], serotonin, lactate, nitric 
oxide [Omura, et al., 2001]). These substances are also involved in 
tumor development.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Besides 
inhibiting enzymes and being converted into prostaglandins, the polyunsaturated 
fatty acids have direct effects, as signals (or interference with signals) 
on many tissues. The belief that the PUFA are essential nutrients has 
influenced the way cellular excitability thresholds are being interpreted. 
Anxiety and panic may be interpreted as alertness, calmness may be interpreted 
as stupidity. Specifically, long-term potentiation (LTP) may contribute 
to seizures, senility, and excitotoxicity, as well as to learning, but 
many titles and conclusions equate increased LTP with &quot;improved 
LTP,&quot; implying that it has biological value to the animal. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
ability of nerve cells to become quiescent after excitation is essential 
to learning and perception. This ability is lost with aging, as the 
functional balance in the brain shifts away from GABA-ergic to glutamatergic 
nerves. The polyunsaturated fatty acids promote the excitatory nervous 
state. The combination of respiratory inhibition with excitation can 
produce excitotoxic cell death. If the doctrine of &quot;essentiality 
of PUFA&quot; hadn&#39;t been so influential, different interpretations 
of excitatory thresholds, energy metabolism, and even cell structure 
would have been allowed to develop more fully.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
concentration of polyunsaturated fats in the brain has led many people 
to say that the &quot;nutritionally essential fatty acids,&quot; especially 
the omega -3 fatty acids, are essential for brain development (for the 
formation of nerve cell membranes), and for the formation of synapses, 
and that increasing the amount of those fats in the diet would be desirable. 
The types of argument they use simply ignore the real evidence<b>:</b> 

Cells can multiply indefinitely in culture dishes without the essential 
fatty acids, insects can multiply for generations on diets without the 
unsaturated fats, forming normal synapses and brains, and mammals fed 
diets with extremely small amounts of the unsaturated fats grow with 
perfectly normal--possibly superior--brains.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">One 
of the fats in the omega -9 series, that the human body can synthesize, 
nervonic acid, is a major constituent of brain tissue, but its important 
functions in brain development have hardly been investigated. Unlike 
the unsaturated fatty acids oleic acid, linoleic acid, and eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA), nervonic acid isn&#39;t associated with the &quot;coronary risk 
factors,&quot; and it has been suggested that it might be used in adults 
to prevent obesity-related diseases. (Oda, et al., 2005).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">One 
major area of research that has been neglected involves the role of 
fats in modifying the ways in which proteins and nucleic acids interact 
with water--arguably the most basic of all physiological processes. 
Unsaturated fats are more water soluble than saturated fats, and they 
are involved in many problems of permeability and edema.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
aging and evolution, there are systematic changes in tissue water content 
that appear to correspond to changes in rate of metabolism, to the degree 
of unsaturation of cellular fats, and to thyroid function and temperature. 
Metabolic intensity and longevity can be modified by changing the degree 
of saturation of fats in the diet and tissues, but--despite almost a 
century of sporadic investigations--no one has yet worked out in detail 
the most appropriate way to do this. But it has become clear that the 
&quot;uncoupled&quot; mitochondrion, that &quot;wastes oxygen and calories,&quot; 

is protective against free radicals, cancer, and aging. Thyroid hormone 
and the absence of PUFA are important factors in supporting the &quot;wasteful&quot; 
mitochondrion. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Although 
the complex interactions of anatomy, energy, temperature, fat nutrition, 
tissue water content, and hormones haven&#39;t been systematically investigated, 
some of the principles regarding the biological suitability of specific 
fats are already being applied in the limited context of therapy. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">At 
present, the most important issue is to recognize the dangers presented 
by the intrusion of corporate power into science, especially as it relates 
to nutrition and medicine, and to consider the implications of the known 
effects of the PUFA on all of our biological systems.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
food-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids play important roles in the 
development of all of the problems associated with aging--reduced immunity, 
insomnia, decreased learning ability, substitution of fat for muscle, 
susceptibility to tissue peroxidation and inflammation, growth of tumors, 
etc., and are probably involved in most other health problems, even 
in children. If research hadn&#39;t been guided by the economic interests 
of the seed oil industry, many of those problems would have been solved 
by now.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
influence of the mass media on science can be seen in two issues that 
are currently well known. </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">A 
popular test used for evaluating diabetes is the measurement of glycated 
hemoglobin, the attachment of a sugar-like fragment to the protein of 
hemoglobin. This is used to judge whether blood sugar is being controlled 
adequately. The glycation of proteins is widely believed to be a central 
process in aging, and is often used to argue that people should reduce 
their sugar consumption.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Another 
well publicized problem supposedly involving the reaction between sugars 
and proteins has to do with the discovery of the carcinogen, acrylamide, 
in breads and french fries. The Whole Foods Market was sued in California 
for selling whole wheat bread without a warning that it contained a 
carcinogen.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">But 
the changes in proteins that occur in diabetes are mainly produced by 
the breakdown products of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Acrylamide is 
produced largely by the reaction of PUFA with proteins. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Sugar, 
by reducing the level of free fatty acids in the body, actually tends 
to protect against these toxic effects of the PUFA. Diabetes, like cancer, 
has been known for a long time to be promoted by unsaturated oils in 
the diet, rather than by sugar. The seed oil industry has been more 
effective than the sugar industry in lobbying and advertising, and the 
effects can be seen in the assumptions that shape medical and biological 
research.</font> <br></p>

A, Portero-Otin M, Bellmunt MJ, Pamplona R, Barja G. &quot;Previous 
comparative studies have shown that long-lived animals have lower fatty 
acid double bond content in their mitochondrial membranes than short-lived 
ones. In order to ascertain whether this trait protects mitochondria 
by decreasing lipid and protein oxidation and oxygen radical generation, 
the double bond content of rat heart mitochondrial membranes was manipulated 
by chronic feeding with semi-purified AIN-93G diets rich in highly unsaturated 
(UNSAT) or saturated (SAT) oils. UNSAT rat heart mitochondria had significantly 
higher double bond content and lipid peroxidation than SAT mitochondria. 
They also showed increased levels of the markers of protein oxidative 
damage malondialdehyde-lysine, protein carbonyls, and N(e)-(carboxymethyl)lysine

of fatty acid unsaturation of heart mitochondria increases oxidative 
damage to their lipids and proteins, and can also increase their rates 
of mitochondrial oxygen radical generation in situations in which the 
degree of reduction of Complex III is higher than normal. These observations 
strengthen the notion that the relatively low double bond content of 
the membranes of long-lived animals could have evolved to protect them
