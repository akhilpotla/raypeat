GLOSSARY</b></font></p></ul></ul></ul>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif"><b>Aerobic 
glycolysis,</b> the conversion of glucose to lactic acid even in the 
presence of oxygen. The presence of oxygen normally restrains glycolysis 
so that glucose is converted to carbon dioxide instead of lactic acid.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif"><b>Anaerobic 
glycolysis,</b> the increased conversion of glucose to lactic acid when 
the supply of oxygen isn&#39;t sufficient, which is a normal event during 
intense muscle action.</font> <br></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif"><b>&quot;Warburg 
Effect&quot;</b> refers to Otto Warburg&#39;s observation that cancer cells 
produce lactic acid even in the presence of adequate oxygen. Cancer 
cells don&#39;t &quot;live on glucose,&quot; since they are highly adapted 
to survive on protein and fats.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif"><b>Pasteur 
Effect,</b> the normal response of cells to restrain glycolysis in the 
presence of adequate oxygen.</font> <br></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif"><b>Crabtree 
Effect,</b> observed originally in yeast, refers to the inhibition of 
respiration in the presence of glucose. This occurs in cancers (e.g., 
Miralpeix, et al., 1990) and in rapidly proliferating normal cells (e.g., 
Guppy, et al., 1993).</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif"><b>&quot;Cancer 
metabolism&quot;</b> or stress metabolism typically involves an excess 
of the adaptive hormones, resulting from an imbalance of the demands 
made on the organism and the resources available to the organism. Excessive 
stimulation depletes glucose and produces lactic acid, and causes cortisol 
to increase, causing a shift to the consumption of fat and protein rather 
than glucose. Increased cortisol activates the Randle effect (the inhibition 
of glucose oxidation by free fatty acids), accelerates the breakdown 
of protein into amino acids, and activates the enzyme fatty acid synthase, 
which produces fatty acids from amino acids and pyruvate, to be oxidized 
in a &quot;futile cycle,&quot; producing heat, and increasing the liberation 
of ammonia from the amino acids. Ammonia suppresses respiratory, and 
stimulates glycolytic, activity.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">                     <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">=========<WBR>==============================<WBR>====</font> <br>

</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
presence of lactic acid in our tissues is very meaningful, but it is 
normally treated as only an indicator, rather than as a cause, of biological 
problems. Its presence in rosacea, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, 
neurological diseases and cancer has been recognized, and recently it 
is being recognized that suppressing it can be curative, after fifty 
years of denial. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
influence of politics on science is so profound that neither historians 
nor scientists often care to consider it honestly and in depth.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">From 
the 19th century until the second quarter of the 20th century, cancer 
was investigated mainly as a metabolic problem. This work, understanding 
the basic chemistry of metabolism, was culminating in the 1920s in the 
work of Otto Warburg and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi on respiration. Warburg 
demonstrated as early as 1920 that a respiratory defect, causing aerobic 
glycolysis, i.e., the production of lactic acid even in the presence 
of oxygen, was an essential feature of cancer. (The formation of lactic 
acid is normal and adaptive when the supply of oxygen isn&#39;t adequate 
to meet energy demands, for example when running.)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Many 
people recognized that this was likely to be the key to the &quot;cancer 
problem.&quot; But in the US, several factors came together to block 
this line of investigation.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
world wars contributed to the isolation of German scientists, and Warburg, 
of the famous Jewish banking family, continued his work in Germany with 
the support of the government, despite his open opposition to Nazism. 
In the years after the war, nothing positive could be said in the US 
about his work on cancer.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
metabolic interpretation of disease that had been making progress for 
several decades was suddenly submerged when government research financing 
began concentrating on genetic and viral interpretations of disease.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">If 
an apparently non-infectious disease couldn&#39;t be explained on the basis 
of an inherited tendency---insanity, epilepsy, diabetes, toxemia of 
pregnancy, and cancer, for example---then genetic changes occurring 
in the individual, as a result of chance or a virus, were invoked. Nutrition 
and other conditions of life were until fairly recently said to have 
no influence on health if the person consumed sufficient calories and 
a minimum amount of the essential vitamins, minerals, and protein. The 
cult of genetic determinism was so powerful that it wasn&#39;t affected 
by the facts.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">In 
1932, a pediatrician, Alexis Hartmann (with M. Senn) in St. Louis, injected 
intravenously a solution of sodium lactate into patients with metabolic 
acidosis, and several of them survived---despite the fact that some 
of them were already suffering from an excess of lactate. The subsequent 
widespread use of lactate solutions in hospitals has contributed to 
the general denial of its toxicity.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Hartmann 
and Senn used racemic lactate, that is, a mixture of D-lactate and L-lactate. 
Our own tissues produce mostly L-lactate, but they can produce small 
amounts of D-lactate; larger amounts are produced by diabetics. Intestinal 
bacteria can produce large amounts of it, and it has many toxic effects. 
Methylglyoxal can be formed from either form of lactate, and it is an 
important factor in the glycation of proteins. It can also be formed 
from MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation. Protein glycation is an important 
factor in diabetes and aging, but glucose, rather than lactate and polyunsaturated 
fats, is commonly said to be the cause.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">About 
50 years ago, lactate was known to induce the formation of new blood 
vessels, and for a much longer time it has been known to cause vasodilation 
and edema. In 1968, it was shown to stimulate collagen synthesis.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Normally, 
collagen synthesis and neovascularization are caused by lack of oxygen, 
but lactate can cause them to occur even in the presence of oxygen. 
Maintenance of a normal extracellular matrix is essential for normal 
functioning and cellular differentiation. Abnormally stimulated collagen 
synthesis probably accelerates tumor growth (Rajkumar, et al., 2006). </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Nervous 
and hormonal factors can cause lactate to accumulate, even without prior 
damage to the mitochondria (e.g., B. Levy, et al., 2003). Psychological, 
as well as physical, stress and overactivation of glutamate receptors 
can cause harmful accumulation of lactate in the brain (Uehara, et al., 
2005). Rather than just being &quot;associated with&quot; tissue damage, 
lactate directly contributes to the damage, for example in the brain, 
causing nerve cell loss by increasing the release of excitotoxic glutamate 
(Xiang, et al, 2004). When a panic reaction is produced by sodium lactate, 
the reduction of protective neurosteroids appears to contribute to the 
excitatory state (Eser, et al. 2006); this would make the brain more 
susceptible to damage.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif"> 
Lactate increases blood viscosity, mimics stress, causes inflammation, 
and contributes to shock. Lactated Ringer&#39;s solution contributes to 
the tissue damage caused by shock, when it&#39;s used to resuscitate shock 
victims (Deree, et al., 2007, 2008): it contributes to the inflammatory 
processes associated with shock, unlike the use of hypertonic saline 
and other solutions. Lactate contributes to diabetes, inhibiting the 
ability to oxidize glucose. It promotes endothelial cell migration and 
leakiness, with increased vascular permeability factor (VPF or vascular 
endothelial growth factor, VEGF) (Nagy, et al. 1985): this can lead 
to breakdown of the &quot;blood-brain barrier.&quot; </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">In 
the brain, lactate can cause nerve damage, increasing intracellular 
fat accumulation, chromatin clumping, and mitochondrial swelling (Norenberg, 
et al., 1987).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
lactate in peritoneal dialysis solution impairs differentiation and 
maturation of (immune, monocyte derived) dendritic cells; according 
to the authors of the study, &quot;These findings have important implications 
for the initiation of immune responses under high lactate conditions, 
such as those occurring within tumor tissues or after macrophage activation<b>&quot; </b>
(Puig-Kröger, et al., 2003).<b> </b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Lactate 
also causes macrophages and synovial fibroblasts to release PGE2, which 
can contribute to inflammation and bone resorption (Dawes and Rushton, 
1994). This is the prostaglandin known to activate the formation of 
estrogen (Haffty, et al., 2008).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Hartmann&#39;s 
lactated solution has been widely used in hospitals for resuscitation 
and for patients after heart surgery and other stressful procedures, 
but until recently only a few people have objected to its use, and most 
of the objection has been to the use of racemic lactate, rather than 
to lactate itself. In recent years several studies have compared hypertonic 
saline (lacking the minerals considered essential since Sydney Ringer 
formulated his solution around 1885), and have found it in some cases 
superior to the &quot;balanced&quot; lactate solution. Even hypertonic 
glucose, without minerals, has produced good results in some studies.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">A 
solution containing a large amount of lactate has been used for peritoneal 
dialysis when there is kidney failure, but several studies have compared 
solutions using bicarbonate instead of lactate, and found that they 
don&#39;t cause the severe damage that always happened with the traditional 
solution.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">While 
Warburg was investigating the roles of glycolysis and respiration in 
cancer,<b> </b>a physician with a background in chemistry, W.F. Koch, 
in Detroit, was showing that the ability to use oxygen made the difference 
between health and sickness, and that the cancer metabolism could be 
corrected by restoring the efficient use of oxygen. He argued that a 
respiratory defect was responsible for immunodeficiency, allergy, and 
defective function of muscles, nerves, and secretory cells, as well 
as cancer. Koch&#39;s idea of cancer&#39;s metabolic cause and its curability 
directly challenged the doctrine of the genetic irreversibility of cancer 
that was central to governmental and commercial medical commitments.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Albert 
Szent-Gyorgyi respected Koch&#39;s work, and spent years investigating the 
involvement of the lactate metabolites, methylgyoxal and glyoxal, in 
cell physiology, but since the government&#39;s campaign against Koch was 
still active when Szent-Gyorgyi came to the U.S., he worked out many 
of the implications of Koch&#39;s work relating to cellular oxidation without 
mentioning his name.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Lactate 
formation from glucose is increased when anything interferes with respiratory 
energy production, but lactate, through a variety of mechanisms, can 
itself suppress cellular respiration. (This has been called the Crabtree 
effect.) Lactate can also inhibit its own formation, slowing glycolysis. 
In the healthy cell, the mitochondrion keeps glycolysis working by consuming 
pyruvate and electrons (or &quot;hydrogens&quot;) from NADH, keeping 
the cell highly oxidized, with a ratio of NAD+/NADH of about 200. When 
the mitochondrion&#39;s ability to consume pyruvate and NADH is limited, 
the pyruvate itself accepts the hydrogen from NADH, forming lactic acid 
and NAD+ in the process. As long as lactate leaves the cell as fast 
as it forms, glycolysis will provide ATP to allow the cell to survive. 
Oxygen and pyruvate are normally &quot;electron sinks,&quot; regenerating 
the NAD+ needed to produce energy from glucose.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">But 
if too much lactate is present, slowing glycolytic production of ATP, 
the cell with defective respiration will die unless an alternative electron 
sink is available. The synthesis of fatty acids is such a sink, if electrons 
(hydrogens) can be transferred from NADH to NADP+, forming NADPH, which 
is the reducing substance required for turning carbohydrates and pyruvate 
and amino acids into fats. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">This 
transfer can be activated by the transhydrogenase enzymes in the mitochondria, 
and also by interactions of some dehydrogenase enzymes.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
enzyme, fatty acid synthase (FAS), normally active in the liver and 
fat cells and in the estrogen-stimulated uterus, is highly active in 
cancers, and its activity is an inverse indicator of prognosis.  
Inhibiting it can cause cancer cells to die, so the pharmaceutical industry 
is looking for drugs that can safely inhibit it. This enzyme is closely 
associated with the rate of cell proliferation, and its activity is 
increased by both cortisol and estrogen.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
first biochemical event when a cell responds to estrogen is the synthesis 
of fat. Estrogen can activate transhydrogenases, and early studies of 
estrogen&#39;s biological effects provided considerable evidence that its 
actions were the result of the steroid molecule&#39;s direct participation 
in hydrogen transfers, oxidations and reductions. E.V. Jensen&#39;s claim 
that estrogen acts only through a &quot;receptor protein&quot; which 
activated gene transcription was based on his experimental evidence 
indicating that estrogen doesn&#39;t participate in oxidation and reduction 
processes in the uterus, but subsequently his claim has turned out to 
be false.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Glycolysis 
is very inefficient for producing usable energy compared to the respiratory 
metabolism of the mitochondria, and when lactate is carried to the liver, 
its conversion to glucose adds to the energy drain on the organism. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
hypoglycemia and related events resulting from accelerated glycolysis 
provide a stimulus for increased activity of the adaptive hormones, 
including cortisol. Cortisol helps to maintain blood sugar by increasing 
the conversion of protein to amino acids, and mobilizing free fatty 
acids from fat stores. The free fatty acids inhibit the use of glucose, 
so the stress metabolism relies largely on the consumption of amino 
acids. This increases the formation of ammonia, yet the combination 
of glycolysis and fat oxidation provides less carbon dioxide, which 
is needed for the conversion of ammonia to urea. Ammonia stimulates 
the formation of lactate, while carbon dioxide inhibits it.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Starving 
an animal with a tumor increases the stress hormones, providing free 
fatty acids and amino acids, and accelerates the tumor&#39;s growth (Sauer 
and Dauchy, 1987); it&#39;s impossible to &quot;starve a tumor,&quot; by 
the methods often used. Preventing the excessive breakdown of protein 
and reducing the release of fatty acids from fat cells would probably 
cause many cancer cells to die, despite the availability of glucose, 
because of lactate&#39;s toxic effects, combined with the energy deficit 
caused by the respiratory defect that causes their aerobic glycolysis. 
Recently, the intrinsically high rate of cell death in tumors has been 
recognized. The tumor is maintained and enlarged by the recruitment 
of &quot;stem cells.&quot; These cells normally would repair or regenerate 
the tissue, but under the existing metabolic conditions, they fail to 
differentiate properly.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
extracellular matrix in the tumor is abnormal, as well as the metabolites 
and signal substances being produced there, and the new cells fail to 
receive the instructions needed to restore the normal functions to the 
damaged tissue. These abnormal conditions can cause abnormal differentiation, 
and this cellular state is likely to involve chemical modification of 
proteins, including remodeling of the chromosomes through acetylation 
of the histones (Alam, et al., 2008; Suuronen, et al., 2006). The protein-protective 
effects of carbon dioxide are replaced by the protein-damaging effects 
of lactate and its metabolites.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
ability of lactic acid to displace carbon dioxide is probably involved 
in its effects on the blood clotting system. It contributes to disseminated 
intravascular coagulation and consumption coagulopathy, and increases 
the tendency of red cells to aggregate, forming &quot;blood sludge,&quot; 
and makes red cells more rigid, increasing the viscosity of blood and 
impairing circulation in the small vessels. (Schmid-Schönbein, 1981; 
Kobayashi, et al., 2001; Martin, et al., 2002; Yamazaki, et al., 2006.)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
features of the stress metabolism include increases of stress hormones, 
lactate, ammonia, free fatty acids, and fat synthesis, and a decrease 
in carbon dioxide. Factors that lower the stress hormones, increase 
carbon dioxide, and help to lower the circulating free fatty acids, 
lactate, and ammonia, include vitamin B1 (to increase CO2 and reduce 
lactate), niacinamide (to reduce free fatty acids), sugar (to reduce 
cortisol, adrenaline, and free fatty acids), salt (to lower adrenaline), 
thyroid hormone (to increase CO2). Vitamins D, K, B6 and biotin are 
also closely involved with carbon dioxide metabolism. Biotin deficiency 
can cause aerobic glycolysis with increased fat synthesis (Marshall, 
et al., 1976). </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">A 
protein deficiency, possibly by increasing cortisol, is likely to contribute 
to increased FAS and fat synthesis (Bannister, et al., 1983), but the 
dietary protein shouldn&#39;t provide an excess of tryptophan, because of 
tryptophan&#39;s role as serotonin precursor--serotonin increases inflammation 
and glycolysis (Koren-Schwartzer, et al., 1994). </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Incidental 
stresses, such as strenuous exercise combined with fasting (e.g., running 
or working before eating breakfast) not only directly trigger the production 
of lactate and ammonia, they also are likely to increase the absorption 
of bacterial endotoxin from the intestine. Endotoxin is a ubiquitous 
and chronic stressor. It increases lactate and nitric oxide, poisoning 
mitochondrial respiration, precipitating the secretion of the adaptive 
stress hormones, which don&#39;t always fully repair the cellular damage.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Aspirin 
protects cells in many ways, interrupting excitotoxic processes by blocking 
nitric oxide and prostaglandins, and consequently it inhibits cell proliferation, 
and in some cases inhibits glycolysis, but the fact that it can inhibit 
FAS (Beynen, et al., 1982) is very important in understanding its role 
in cancer.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">There 
are several specific signals produced by lactate that can promote growth 
and other features of cancer, and it happens that aspirin antagonizes 
those: HIF, NF-kappaB, the kinase cascades, cyclin D1, and heme oxygenase. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Lactate 
and inflammation promote each other in a vicious cycle (Kawauchi, et 
al., 2008).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">The 
toxic mechanism of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) involves 
inappropriate stimulation (Wang and White, 1999) of cells, followed 
by inflammation and mitochondrial inhibition. The stimulation seems 
to be a direct &quot;biophysical&quot; action on cells, causing them 
to take up water (Minutoli, et al., 2008), which is especially interesting, 
since estrogen&#39;s immediate excitatory effect causes cells to take up 
water.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Hypoosmolarity 
itself is excitatory and anabolic. It stimulates lipolysis and fat oxidation 
(Keller, et al. 2003), and osmotic swelling stimulates glycolysis and 
inhibits mitochondrial respiration (Levko, et al., 2000). Endotoxin 
causes hyponatremia (Tyler, et al., 1994), and a hypertonic salt solution 
is protective, lactate solutions are harmful. Other stresses and inflammations 
also cause hyponatremia.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">One 
of the effects of endotoxin that leads to prolonged cellular excitation 
is its inhibition of the glucuronidation system (Bánhegyi, et al., 
1995), since this inhibition allows excitatory estrogen to accumulate.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">In 
women and rats, antibiotics were found to cause blood levels of estrogen 
and cortisol to decrease, while progesterone increased. This effect 
apparently resulted from the liver&#39;s increased ability to inactivate 
estrogen and to maintain blood sugar when the endotoxin stress was decreased.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Now 
that hog farmers&#39; use of antibiotics to stimulate growth has been discouraged, 
they have sought vegetables that have a natural antibiotic effect, reducing 
the formation and absorption of the intestinal toxins. The human diet 
can be similarly adjusted, to minimize the production and absorption 
of the bacterial toxins. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">In 
2007, two Canadian researchers announced that they were investigating 
the drug dichloroacetate, which blocks glycolysis, stopping the production 
of lactic acid, as a cancer treatment, with success. The drug (dichloroacetate) 
has toxic side effects, but it is useful in several other conditions 
involving over-production of lactic acid. Other drugs that inhibit glycolysis 
have also shown anticancer effects in animals, but are in themselves 
very toxic. On the theoretical level, it would be better to inhibit 
only aerobic glycolysis, rather than inhibiting enzymes that are essential 
for all glycolysis.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Since 
endotoxemia can produce aerobic glycolysis in an otherwise healthy person 
(Bundgaard, et al., 2003), a minimally &quot;Warburgian&quot; approach--i.e,, 
a merely reasonable approach--would involve minimizing the absorption 
of endotoxin. Inhibiting bacterial growth, while optimizing intestinal 
resistance, would have no harmful side effects. Preventing excessive 
sympathetic nervous activity and maintaining the intestine&#39;s energy 
production can be achieved by optimizing hormones and nutrition. Something 
as simple as a grated carrot with salt and vinegar can produce major 
changes in bowel health, reducing endotoxin absorption, and restoring 
constructive hormonal functions.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">Medical 
tradition and inertia make it unlikely that the connection between cancer 
and bowel toxins will be recognized by the mainstream of medicine and 
governemt. In another article I will describe some of the recent history 
relating to this issue. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">It&#39;s 
nice that some cancer researchers are now remembering Warburg, but unfortunately 
they are usually just fitting the fact of cancer&#39;s aerobic glycolysis 
into the genetic mutant cell paradigm, thinking of the respiratory defect 
as just another opportunity for killing the evil deviant cancer cell, 
rather than looking for the causes of the respiratory defect. Warburg, 
Koch, and Szent-Gyorgyi had a comprehensive view of biology, in which 
the aerobic production of lactate, resulting from a respiratory defect, 
itself was functonally related to the nature of cancer. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif">A 
focus on correcting the respiratory defect would be relevant for all 
of the diseases and conditions (including heart disease, diabetes, dementia) 
involving inflammation and inappropriate excitation, not just for cancer.</font> <br>

rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, in the membrane-skeleton fraction 
from erythrocytes. Concomitantly, the hormone induced a striking increase 
in lactate content, reflecting stimulation of glycolysis. The enzyme&#39;s 
activity in the cytosolic (soluble) fraction remained unchanged. These 
results suggest a defense mechanism in the erythrocytes against the
