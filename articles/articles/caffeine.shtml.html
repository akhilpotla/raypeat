Caffeine: A vitamin-like nutrient, or adaptogen</b><p></font>

<font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>
Questions about tea and coffee, cancer and other degenerative diseases, and the hormones.</b><p>
     <p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">There 
is a popular health-culture that circulates mistaken ideas about nutrition, 
and coffee drinking has been a perennial target of this culture.  
It is commonly said that coffee is a drug, not a food, and that its 
drug action is harmful, and that this harm is not compensated by any 
nutritional benefit.  Most physicians subscribe to most of these 
“common sense” ideas about coffee, and form an authoritative barrier 
against the assimilation of scientific information about coffee.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">I 
think it would be good to reconsider coffee’s place in the diet and 
in health care.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"> <b>Coffee 
drinkers have a lower incidence of thyroid disease, including cancer, 
thannon-drinkers.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Caffeine 
protects the liver from alcohol and acetaminophen (Tylenol) and other 
toxins, and coffee drinkers are less likely than people who don’t 
use coffee to have elevated serum enzymes and other indications of liver 
damage.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Caffeine 
protects against cancer caused by radiation, chemical carcinogens, viruses, 
and estrogens.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Caffeine 
synergizes with progesterone, and increases its concentration in blood 
and tissues.</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Cystic 
breast disease is not caused by caffeine, in fact caffeine’s effects 
are likely to be protective; a variety of studies show that coffee, 
tea, and caffeine are protective against breast cancer.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Coffee 
provides very significant quantities of magnesium, as well as other 
nutrients including vitamin B1.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Caffeine 
“improves efficiency of fuel use” and performance:

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Coffee 
drinkers have a low incidence of suicide.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Caffeine 
supports serotonin uptake in nerves, and inhibits blood platelet aggregation.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Coffee 
drinkers have been found to have lower cadmium in tissues; coffee making 
removes heavy metals from water.</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Coffee 
inhibits iron absorption if taken with meals, helping to prevent iron 
overload.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Caffeine, 
like niacin, inhibits apoptosis, protecting against stress-induced cell 
death, without interfering with normal cell turnover.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Caffeine 
can prevent nerve cell death.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Coffee 
(or caffeine) prevents Parkinson’s Disease 
(Ross, et al., 2000).</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>The 
prenatal growth retardation that can be caused by feeding large amounts 
of caffeine is prevented by supplementing the diet with sugar.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Caffeine 
stops production of free radicals by inhibiting 
xanthine oxidase, an important factor in tissue stress. </b></font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Caffeine 
lowers serum potassium following exercise; stabilizes platelets, reducing 
thromboxane production.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">One 
definition of a vitamin is that it is an organic chemical found in foods, 
the lack of which <b><i>causes</i></b> a specific <b><i>disease,</i></b> 
or group of diseases.  A variety of substances that have been proposed 
to be vitamins haven’t been recognized as being essential, and some 
substances that aren’t essential are sometimes called vitamins.  
Sometimes these issues haven’t had enough scientific investigation, 
but often nonscientific forces regulate nutritional ideas.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
definition of “a disease” isn’t as clear as text-book writers 
have implied, and “causality” in biology is always more complex 
than we like to believe.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Nutrition 
is one of the most important sciences, and should certainly be as prestigious 
and well financed as astrophysics and nuclear physics, but while people 
say “it doesn’t take a brain surgeon to figure that out,” no one 
says “it doesn’t take a nutritionist to understand that.”  
Partly, that’s because medicine treated scientific nutrition as an 
illegitimate step-child, and refused throughout the 20th century to 
recognize that it is a central part of scientific health care.  
In the 1970s, physicians and dietitians were still ridiculing the idea 
that vitamin E could prevent or cure diseases of the circulatory system, 
and babies as well as older people were given “total intravenous nutrition” 
which lacked nutrients that are essential to life, growth, immunity, 
and healing.  Medicine and science are powerfully institutionalized, 
but no institution or profession has existed for the purpose of encouraging 
people to act reasonably.  </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
this environment, most people have felt that subtleties of definition, 
logic and evidence weren’t important for nutrition, and a great amount 
of energy has gone into deciding whether there were “four food groups” 
or “seven food groups” or a “nutritional pyramid.”  The 
motives behind governmental and quasi-governmental nutrition policies 
usually represent something besides a simple scientific concern for 
good health, as when health care institutions say that Mexican babies 
should begin eating beans when they reach the age of six months, or 
that non-whites don’t need milk after they are weaned.  In a 
culture that discourages prolonged breast feeding, the effects of these 
doctrines can be serious.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">After 
a century of scientific nutrition, public nutritional policies are doing 
approximately as much harm as good, and they are getting worse faster 
than they are getting better..  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
this culture, what we desperately need is a recognition of the complexity 
of life, and of the political-ecological situation we find ourselves 
in. Any thinking which isn’t “system thinking” should be treated 
with caution, and most contemporary thinking about health neglects to 
consider relevant parts of the problem-system.  “Official” 
recommendations about salt, cholesterol, iron, unsaturated and saturated 
fats, and soybeans have generally been inappropriate, unscientific, 
and strongly motivated by business interests rather than by biological 
knowledge.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Definitions 
have rarely distinguished clearly between nutrients and drugs, and new 
commercial motives are helping to further blur the distinctions.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"><b>Essential 
nutrients, defensive (detoxifying, 
antistress) nutrients, hormone-modulating nutrients, self-actualization 
nutrients, growth regulating nutrients, structure modifiers, life extension 
agents, transgenerationally active (imprinting)</b> <b>nutrients--</b>the 
line between nutrients and biological modifiers often depends on the 
situation. Vitamins D and A clearly have hormone-like properties, and 
vitamin E’s effects, and those of many terpenoids and steroids and 
bioflavonoids found in foods, include hormone-like actions as well as 
antioxidant and pro-oxidant functions.  The concept of “adaptogen” 
can include things that act like both drugs and nutrients.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Some 
studies have suggested that trace amounts of nutrients could be passed 
on for a few generations, but the evidence now indicates that these 
transgenerational effects are caused by phenomena such as “imprinting.”  
But the hereditary effects of nutrients are so complex that their recognition 
would force nutrition to be recognized as one of the most complex sciences, 
interwoven with the complexities of growth and development.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
idea that poor nutrition stunts growth has led to the idea that good 
nutrition can be defined in terms of the rate of growth and the size 
ultimately reached.  In medicine, it is common to refer to an obese 
specimen as “well nourished,” as if quantity of food and quantity 
of tissue were necessarily good things.  But poisons can stimulate 
growth (“hormes</font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">is”), 
and food restriction can extend longevity.  <b>We still have to 
determine basic things such as the optimal rate of growth, and the optimal 
size.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Nutrition 
textbooks flatly describe caffeine as a drug, not a nutrient, as if 
it were obvious that nutrients can’t be drugs.  Any of the essential 
nutrients, if used in isolation, can be used as a drug, for a specific 
effect on the organism that it wouldn’t normally have when eaten as 
a component of ordinary food.  And natural foods contain thousands 
of chemicals, other than the essential nutrients.  Many of these 
are called nonessential nutrients, but their importance is being recognized 
increasingly.  The truth is that we aren’t sure what they “aren’t 
essential” for.  Until we have more definite knowledge about 
the organism I don’t think we should categorize things so absolutely 
as drugs or nutrients.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
bad effects ascribed to coffee usually involve administering large doses 
in a short period of time.  While caffeine is commonly said to 
raise blood pressure, this effect is slight, and may not occur during 
the normal use of coffee.  Experimenters typically ignore essential 
factors.  Drinking plain water can cause an extreme rise in blood 
pressure, especially in old people, and eating a meal (containing carbohydrate) 
lowers blood pressure.  The increased metabolic rate caffeine produces 
increases the cellular consumption of glucose, so experiments that study 
the effects of coffee taken on an empty stomach are measuring the effects 
of increased temperature and metabolic rate, combined with increased 
adrenaline (resulting from the decrease of glucose), and so confuse 
the issue of caffeine’s intrinsic effects. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
one study (Krasil’nikov, 1975), the drugs were introduced directly 
into the carotid artery to study the effects on the blood vessels in 
the brain.  Caffeine increased the blood volume in the brain, while 
decreasing the resistance of the vessels, and this effect is what would 
be expected from its stimulation of brain metabolism and the consequent 
increase in carbon dioxide, which dilates blood vessels.  </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
the whole body, increased carbon dioxide also decreases vascular resistance, 
and this allows circulation to increase, while the heart’s work is 
decreased, relative to the amount of blood pumped.  But when the 
whole body’s metabolism is increased, adequate nutrition is crucial.  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">In 
animal experiments that have been used to argue that pregnant women 
shouldn’t drink coffee, large doses of caffeine given to pregnant 
animals retarded the growth of the fetuses.  But simply giving 
more sucrose prevented the growth retardation.  Since caffeine 
tends to correct some of the metabolic problems that could interfere 
with pregnancy, it is possible that rationally constructed experiments 
could show benefits to the fetus from the mother’s use of coffee, 
for example by lowering bilirubin and serotonin, preventing hypoglycemia, 
increasing uterine perfusion and progesterone synthesis, synergizing 
with thyroid and cortisol to promote lung maturation, and providing 
additional nutrients.  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">One 
of the most popular misconceptions about caffeine is that it causes 
fibrocystic breast disease.  Several groups demonstrated pretty 
clearly that it doesn’t, but there was no reason that they should 
have had to bother, except for an amazingly incompetent, but highly 
publicized, series of articles--classics of their kind--by J. P. Minton, 
of Ohio State University.  Minton neglected to notice that the 
healthy breast contains a high percentage of fat, and that the inflamed 
and diseased breast has an increased proportion of glandular material  
Fat cells have a low level of cyclic AMP, a regulatory substance that 
is associated with normal cellular differentiation and function, and 
is involved in mediating caffeine’s ability to inhibit cancer cell 
multiplication.  Minton</font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"> 
argued that cAMP increases progressively with the degree of breast disease, 
up to cancer, and that cAMP is increased by caffeine.  A variety 
of substances other than caffeine that inhibit the growth of cancer 
cells (as well as normal breast cells) act by <i>increasing</i> the 
amount of cyclic AMP, while estrogen lowers the amount of cAMP and increases 
cell growth.  Minton’s argument should have been to use more 
caffeine, in proportion to the degree of breast disease, if he were 
arguing logically from his evidence.  Caffeine’s effect on the 
breast resembles that of progesterone, opposing estrogen’s effects.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Many 
studies over the last 30 years have shown caffeine to be highly protective 
against all kinds of carcinogenesis, including estrogen’s carcinogenic 
effects on the breast.  Caffeine is now being used along with some 
of the standard cancer treatments, to improve their effects or to reduce 
their side effects.  There are substances in the coffee berry besides 
caffeine that protect against mutations and cancer, and that have shown 
strong therapeutic effects against cancer.  Although many plant 
substances are protective against mutations and cancer, I don’t know 
of any that is as free of side effects as coffee.</font> <br>

</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">To 
talk about caffeine, it’s necessary to talk about uric acid.  <b>
Uric acid, synthesized in the body, is both a stimulant and a very important 
antioxidant, and its structure is very similar to that of caffeine.  </b>
A deficiency of uric acid is a serious problem.  Caffeine and uric 
acid are in the group of chemicals called purines.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Purines 
(along with pyrimidines) are components of the nucleic acids, DNA and 
RNA, but they have many other functions.  In general, substances 
related to purines are stimulants, and substances related to pyrimidines 
are sedatives.  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">When 
the basic purine structure is oxidized, it becomes in turn hypoxanthine, 
xanthine, and uric acid, by the addition of oxygen atoms.  When 
methyl groups (CH<sub>3</sub>) are added to nitrogens in the purine 
ring, the molecule becomes less water soluble.  Xanthine (an intermediate 
in purine metabolism) has two oxygen atoms, and when three methyl groups 
are added, it becomes trimethyl xanthine, or caffeine.  With two 
methyl groups, it is theophylline,</font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman"> 
which is named for its presence in tea.  We have enzyme systems 
which can add and subtract methyl groups<b>;</b> for example, when babies 
are given theophylline, they can convert it into caffeine.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">We 
have enzymes that can modify all of the methyl groups and oxygen atoms 
of caffeine and the other purine derivatives.  Caffeine is usually 
excreted in a modified form, for example as a methylated uric acid.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">One 
of the ways in which uric acid functions as an “antioxidant” is 
by modifying the activity of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which in stress 
can become a dangerous source of free radicals.  Caffeine also 
restrains this enzyme.  There are several other ways in which uric 
acid and caffeine (and a variety of intermediate xanthines) protect 
against oxidative damage.  Coffee drinkers, for example, have been 
found to have lower levels of cadmium in their kidneys than people who 
don’t use coffee, and coffee is known to inhibit the absorption of 
iron by the intestine, helping to prevent iron overload.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Toxins 
and stressors often kill cells, for example in the brain, liver, and 
immune system, by causing the cells to expend energy faster than it 
can be replaced.  There is an enzyme system that repairs genetic 
damage, called “PARP.”  The activation of this enzyme is a 
major energy drain, and substances that inhibit it can prevent the death 
of the cell.  Niacin and caffeine can inhibit this enzyme sufficiently 
to prevent this characteristic kind of cell death, without preventing 
the normal cellular turnover<b>;</b> that is, they don’t produce tumors 
by preventing the death of cells that aren’t needed.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
purines are important in a great variety of regulatory processes, and 
caffeine fits into this complex system in other ways that are often 
protective against stress.  For example, it has been proposed that 
tea can protect against circulatory disease by preventing abnormal clotting, 
and the mechanism seems to be that caffeine (or theophylline) tends 
to restrain stress-induced platelet aggregaton.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">When 
platelets clump, they release various factors that contribute to the 
development of a clot.  Serotonin is one of these, and is released 
by other kinds of cell, including mast cells and basophils and nerve 
cells.  Serotonin produces vascular spasms and increased blood 
pressure, blood vessel leakiness and inflammation, and the release of 
many other stress mediators.  Caffeine, besides inhibiting the 
platelet aggregation, also tends to inhibit the release of serotonin, 
or to promote its uptake and binding.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">J. 
W. Davis, et al., 1996, found that high uric acid levels seem to protect 
against the development of Parkinson’s disease.  They ascribed 
this effect to uric acid’s antioxidant function.  Coffee drinking, 
which <i>lowers</i> uric acid levels, nevertheless appeared to be much 
more strongly protective against Parkinson’s disease than uric acid.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Possibly 
more important than coffee’s ability to protect the health is the 
way it does it.  The studies that have tried to gather evidence 
to show that coffee is harmful, and found the opposite, have provided 
insight into several diseases.  For example, coffee’s effects 
on serotonin are very similar to carbon dioxide’s, and the thyroid 
hormone’s.  Noticing that coffee drinking is associated with 
a low incidence of Parkinson’s disease could focus attention on the 
ways that thyroid and carbon dioxide and serotonin, estrogen, mast cells, 
histamine and blood clotting interact to produce nerve cell death.  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Thinking 
about how caffeine can be beneficial across such a broad spectrum of 
problems can give us a perspective on the similarities of their underlying 
physiology and biochemistry, expanding the implications of stress, biological 
energy, and adaptability.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
observation that coffee drinkers have a low incidence of suicide, for 
example, might be physiologically related to the large increase in suicide 
rate among people who use the newer antidepressants called “serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors.”  Serotonin excess causes several of the 
features of depression, such as learned helplessness and reduced metabolic 
rate, while coffee stimulates the <i>uptake</i> (inactivation or storage) 
of serotonin, increases metabolic energy, and tends to improve mood.  
In animal studies, it reverses the state of helplessness or despair, 
often more effectively than so-called antidepressants.</font> <br>

</p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">The 
research on caffeine’s effects on blood pressure, and on the use of 
fuel by the more actively metabolizing cells, hasn’t clarified its 
effects on respiration and nutrition, but some of these experiments 
confirm things that coffee drinkers usually learn for themselves.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Often, 
a woman who thinks that she has symptoms of hypoglycemia says that drinking 
even the smallest amount of coffee makes her anxious and shaky.  
Sometimes, I have suggested that they try drinking about two ounces 
of coffee with cream or milk along with a meal.  It’s common 
for them to find that this reduces their symptoms of hypoglycemia, and 
allows them to be symptom-free between meals.  Although we don’t 
know exactly why caffeine improves an athlete’s endurance, I think 
the same processes are involved when coffee increases a person’s “endurance” 
in ordinary activities.  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Caffeine 
has remarkable parallels to thyroid and progesterone, and the use of 
coffee or tea can help to maintain their production, or compensate for 
their deficiency.  Women spontaneously drink more coffee premenstrually, 
and since caffeine is known to increase the concentration of progesterone 
in the blood and in the brain, this is obviously a spontaneous and rational 
form of self-medication, though medical editors like to see things causally 
reversed, and blame the coffee drinking for the symptoms it is actually 
alleviating.  Some women have noticed that the effect of a progesterone 
supplement is stronger when they take it with coffee.  This is 
similar to the synergy between thyroid and progesterone, which is probably 
involved, since caffeine tends to <i>locally</i> activate thyroid secretion 
by a variety of mechanisms, increasing cyclic AMP and decreasing serotonin 
in thyroid cells</font><font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">, for example, 
and also by lowering the systemic stress mediators.  </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,palatino,times,serif,Times New Roman">Medical 
editors like to publish articles that reinforce important prejudices, 
even if, scientifically, they are trash.  The momentum of a bad 
idea can probably be measured by the tons of glossy paper that have 
gone into its development.  Just for the sake of the environment, 
it would be nice if editors would try to think in terms of evidence 
and biological mechanisms, rather than stereotypes.</font> <br>

Effects of intracarotid injections of vasoactive agents on cerebrovascular 
resistance (CVR) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were studied in hemodynamically 
isolated brain of cats. Perfusion pressure shifts at a constant blood 
volume perfusion reflected CVR changes, and changes of venous outflow
