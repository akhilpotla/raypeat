Milk in context: allergies, 
ecology, and some myths</b><br></font> 




<p align="justify">   <font size="3" style="line-height:1.5em;"  face="georgia,times,serif" style="line-height:1.5em;">












<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Food 
allergies are becoming much more common in recent decades, especially 
in industrialized countries. Most attention has been given to theories 
about changes in people, such as the reduction in infectious diseases 
and parasites, or vitamin D deficiency, or harmful effects from vaccinations, 
and little attention has been given to degradation of the food supply.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Our 
food cultures, like linguistic and moral cultures, give us some assumptions 
or theories about the way the world should be, and if these beliefs 
aren&#39;t questioned and tested, they can permeate the culture of science, 
turning the research process into a rationalization of accepted opinions. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">In 
general, those who pay for research are those with an investment in 
or commitment to the preservation and expansion of the existing systems 
of production and distribution. Cheap mass production, durability and 
long shelf-life are more important than the effects of foods on health. 
The biggest industries are usually able to keep public attention away 
from the harm they do.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">The 
historical economic importance of cereals and beans is reflected in 
the nutritional and biochemical research literature, which has paid 
relatively little attention to basic questions about human adaptation 
to the ecosystems. From the early petrochemical “Green Revolution” 
to the contemporary imposition of genetically altered seeds, the accumulated 
economic power of the food industry has taken control of the food culture. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">In 
evaluating each research publication relating to nutrition and health, 
we should ask what alternative possibilities are being neglected, for 
“practical” reasons, cultural preferences, and business interests.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Some 
people with an ecological concern have argued that grains and beans 
can most economically provide the proteins and calories that people 
need, but good nutrition involves much more than the essential nutrients. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">“Efficient” 
industrial agriculture has been concerned with cheaply producing those 
important nutrients, and their critics have focussed on their use of 
toxic chemicals, on the social damage they produce, the degradation 
of the soil, the toxic effects of genetic modification, their unsustainable 
use of petroleum, and occasionally on the lower nutritional value of 
chemically stimulated crops.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">I 
think far too little attention is being given to the effects of abnormal 
and stressful growth conditions on the plants&#39; natural defense systems. 
Plants normally synthesize some toxins and inhibitors of digestive enzymes 
to discourage attacks by bacteria, fungi, insects, and other predators. 
When a plant is injured or otherwise stressed, it produces more of the 
defensive substances, and very often they communicate their stress to 
other plants, and the resulting physiological changes can cause changes 
in seeds that affect the resistance of the progeny. (Agrawal, 2001)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">One 
of many substances produced by plants in response to injury is chitinase, 
an enzyme that breaks down chitin, a polysaccharide that is a structural 
component of fungi and insects. Chitinase, which is produced by bacteria 
and humans, as well as by plants and other organisms, is involved in 
developmental processes as well as in the innate immune system. In plants, 
the enzyme is induced by ethylene and salicylate, in animals by estrogen, 
light damage, and infections, and can be demonstrated in polyps and 
cancers.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">The 
two main classes of plant allergens are the stress-induced chitinases, 
and seed storage proteins, such as gluten. The chitinase allergens are 
responsible for reactions to latex (which is secreted by rubber trees 
in reaction to a wound), bananas, avocados, many other fruits and vegetables, 
and some types of wood and other plant materials. Intensive agricultural 
methods are increasing the formation of the defensive chemicals, and 
the industrialized crops are responsible for the great majority of the 
new allergies that have appeared in the last 30 years.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">The 
presence of the chitinase family of proteins in humans was first discovered 
in the inflamed asthmatic lung. It was then found at high levels in 
the uterine endometrium at the time of implantation of the embryo (an 
inflammation-like situation) and in the uterus during premature labor. 
Since estrogen treatment is known to increase the incidence of asthma 
and other inflammations, the appearance of chitinase also in the uterus 
in estrogen dominated conditions is interesting, especially when the 
role of estrogen in celiac disease (in effect an allergy to gluten) 
is considered. Celiac disease is more prevalent among females, and it 
involves the immunological cross-reaction to an antigen in the estrogen-regulated 
transglutaminase enzyme and the gluten protein. The (calcium-regulated) 
transglutaminase enzyme is involved in the cross-linking of proteins 
in keratinized cells, in fibrotic processes in the liver, and in cancer. 
(People with celiac disease often suffer from osteoporosis and urinary 
stone deposition, showing a general problem with calcium regulation.)</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">This 
means that estrogen and stress cause the appearance of antigens in the 
human or animal tissues that are essentially the same as the stress-induced 
and defensive proteins in plant tissues. A crocodile might experience 
the same sort of allergic reaction when eating estrogen-treated women 
and when eating commercial bananas.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">The 
various states of the innate immune system have been neglected by immunologists, 
for example in relation to organ transplantation. The “major histocompatibility” 
antigens are matched, but organ transplants still sometimes fail. A 
study found that the livers from young men had a high survival rate 
when transplanted into either men or women, but the livers of older 
women donors were rejected at a high rate when transplanted into either 
men or women. Exposure to estrogen increases intracellular calcium and 
the unsaturation of fatty acids in tissue lipids, and the expression 
of enzymes such as chitinase and transglutaminase, and the various enzymes 
in the structure-sensitive estrogen-controlled metabolic pathways.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Estrogen&#39;s 
actions are closely and pervasively involved with the regulation of 
calcium, and these changes affect the basic tissue structures and processes 
that constitute the innate immune system. Estrogen&#39;s effect in increasing 
susceptibility to “autoimmune” diseases hasn&#39;t yet been recognized 
by mainstream medicine.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">The 
chemist Norman Pirie argued convincingly that leaf protein had much 
higher nutritional value than grain and bean proteins, and that it had 
the potential to be much more efficient economically, if it could be 
separated from the less desirable components of leaves. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">The 
amino acid composition and nutritional value of leaf protein is similar 
to milk protein, which is understandable since cows produce milk from 
the amino acids produced in their rumens by bacteria digesting the leaves 
the cows have eaten. The bacteria perform the refining processes that 
Pirie believed could be done technologically, and they also degrade 
or detoxify the major toxins and allergens.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">The 
nutrients produced in the cow&#39;s rumen are selectively absorbed into 
the cow&#39;s bloodstream, where the liver can further filter out any toxins 
before the amino acids and other nutrients are absorbed by the udder 
to be synthesized into milk. If cows are fed extremely bad diets, for 
example with a very large amount of grain, the filtering process is 
less perfect, and some allergens can reach the milk, but since sick 
cows are less profitable than healthy cows, dairies usually feed their 
cows fairly well. </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">In 
a recent study of 69,796 hospitalized newborns, a diagnosis of cow&#39;s 
milk allergy was made in 0.21% of them. Among those whose birthweight 
had been less than a kilogram, 0.35% of them were diagnosed with the 
milk allergy. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the main reason for the 
diagnosis, but a challenge test to confirm the diagnosis was used in 
only 15% of the participating hospitals, and a lymphocyte stimulation 
test was used in only 5.5% of them (Miyazawa, et al., 2009). There are 
many publications about milk allergies, but they generally involve a 
small group of patients, and the tests they use are rarely evaluated 
on healthy control subjects.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Several 
surveys have found that of children who have a diagnosed milk allergy, 
about 2/3 of them grow out of the allergy.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">People 
who have told me that they have had digestive problems with milk have 
sometimes found that a different brand of milk doesn&#39;t cause any problem.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Milk 
with reduced fat content is required by US law to have vitamins D and 
A added. The vehicle used in the vitamin preparation, and the industrial 
contaminants in the “pure” vitamins themselves, are possible sources 
of allergens in commercial milk, so whole milk is the most likely to 
be free of allergens.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">A 
thickening agent commonly used in milk products, carrageenan, is a powerful 
allergen that can cause a “pseudo-latex allergy” (Tarlo, et al., 
1995). It is a sulfated polysaccharide, structurally similar to heparin. 
There are good reasons to think that its toxic effects are the result 
of disturbance of calcium metabolism (see for example Abdullahi, et 
al., 1975; Halici, et al., 2008; Janaswamy and Chandrasekaran, 2008).</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Besides 
the idea of milk allergy, the most common reason for avoiding milk is 
the belief that the genes of some ethnic groups cause them to lack the 
enzyme, lactase, needed to digest milk sugar, lactose, and that this 
causes lactose intolerance, resulting in gas or diarrhea when milk is 
consumed. Tests have been reported in which a glass of milk will cause 
the lactase deficient people to have abdominal pain. However, when intolerant 
people have been tested, using milk without lactose for comparison, 
there were no differences between those receiving milk with lactose 
or without it. The “intolerant” people consistently tolerate having 
a glass with each meal.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">When 
a group of lactase deficient people have been given some milk every 
day for a few weeks, they have adapted, for example with tests showing 
that much less hydrogen gas was produced from lactose by intestinal 
bacteria after they had adapted (Pribila, et al., 2000).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Bacterial 
overgrowth in the small intestine can be caused by hypothyroidism (Lauritano, 
et al., 2007), and the substances produced by these bacteria can damage 
the lining of the small intestine, causing the loss of lactase enzymes 
(Walshe, et al., 1990).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Another 
hormonal condition that probably contributes to lactase deficiency is 
progesterone deficiency, since a synthetic progestin has been found 
to increase the enzyme (Nagpaul, et al., 1990). The particular progestin 
they used lacks many of progesterone&#39;s effects, but it does protect 
against some kinds of stress, including high estrogen and cortisol. 
This suggests that stress, with its increased ratio of estrogen and 
cortisol to progesterone, might commonly cause the enzyme to decrease.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Two 
other ideas that sometimes cause people to avoid drinking milk and eating 
cheese are that they are “fattening foods,” and that the high calcium 
content could contribute to hardening of the arteries.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">When 
I traveled around Europe in 1968, I noticed that milk and cheese were 
hard to find in the Slavic countries, and that many people were fat. 
When I crossed from Russia into Finland, I noticed there were many stores 
selling a variety of cheeses, and the people were generally slender. 
When I lived in Mexico in the 1960s, good milk was hard to find in the 
cities and towns, and most women had fat hips and short legs. Twenty 
years later, when good milk was available in all the cites, there were 
many more slender women, and the young people on average had much longer 
legs. The changes I noticed there reminded me of the differences I had 
seen between Moscow and Helsinki, and I suspect that the differences 
in calcium intake were partly responsible for the changes of physique.</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">In 
recent years there have been studies showing that regular milk drinkers 
are less fat than people who don&#39;t drink it. Although the high quality 
protein and saturated fat undoubtedly contribute to milk&#39;s anti-obesity 
effect, the high calcium content is probably the main factor.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">The 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an important regulator of calcium metabolism. 
If dietary calcium isn&#39;t sufficient, causing blood calcium to decrease, 
the PTH increases, and removes calcium from bones to maintain a normal 
amount in the blood. PTH has many other effects, contributing to inflammation, 
calcification of soft tissues, and decreased respiratory energy production. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">When 
there is adequate calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium in the diet, PTH 
is kept to a minimum. When PTH is kept low, cells increase their formation 
of the uncoupling proteins, that cause mitochondria to use energy at 
a higher rate, and this is associated with decreased activity of the 
fatty acid synthase enzymes.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">These 
changes are clearly related to the anti-obesity effect of calcium, but 
those enzymes are important for many other problems.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">The 
“metabolic syndrome,” that involves diabetes, hypertension, and 
obesity, is associated with high PTH (Ahlström, et al., 2009; Hjelmesaeth, 
et al., 2009).</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Alzheimer&#39;s 
disease involves decreased mitochondrial activity and low levels of 
the uncoupling proteins. There is evidence that milk drinkers are protected 
against dementia (Yamada, et al., 2003). Cancer involves increased activity 
of the fatty acid synthase enzymes. Increased calcium consumption beneficially 
affects both sets of enzymes, uncoupling proteins and fatty acid synthase.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Multiple 
sclerosis relapses consistently occur at times of high PTH, and remissions 
consistently occur at times of low PTH (Soilu-Hänninen, et al., 3008). 
PTH increases the activity of nitric oxide synthase, and nitric oxide 
is a factor in the vascular leakiness that is so important in MS.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">There 
are components of milk that might protect against tooth decay by inhibiting 
the binding of bacteria to teeth (Danielsson, et al., 2009).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">David 
McCarron has published a large amount of evidence showing how calcium 
deficiency contributes to high blood pressure. The chronic elevation 
of PTH caused by calcium deficiency causes the heart and blood vessels 
to retain calcium, making them unable to relax fully.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Intravenous 
infusion of calcium can relax blood vessels and improve heart function. 
The suppression of PTH is probably the main mechanism.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">PTH 
(like estrogen) causes mast cells to release promoters of inflammation, 
including histamine and serotonin. Serotonin and nitric oxide contribute 
to increasing PTH secretion. </font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Removal 
of the parathyroid gland has reduced heart problems and mortality (Costa-Hong, 
et al., 2007) and insomnia (Esposito, et al., 2008; Sabbatini, et al., 
2002) in people with kidney disease and excess PTH.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Increased 
carbon dioxide, for example when adapted to high altitude, can greatly 
decrease PTH. Frequent, but smaller, meals can reduce PTH.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Cancer 
cells often secrete PTH and related proteins with similar effects on 
calcium, and the PTH stimulates the growth and invasiveness of prostate 
cancer (DaSilva, et al., 2009) cells, and seems to be as closely involved 
with breast cancer. The PTH-related protein is associated with calcification 
in breast cancer (Kanbara, et al., 1994). Microscopic calcium crystals 
themselve produce inflammation (Denko and Whitehouse, 1976).</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Besides 
being an ecologically favorable source of calcium, protein, sugar, and 
fat, the composition of milk causes it to be digested efficiently, supporting 
the growth of bacteria that are relatively safe for the intestine and 
liver, and reducing the absorption of endotoxin.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Dividing 
any food into smaller meals can lower the PTH, and milk is a convenient 
food to use in small amounts and frequently. </font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Some 
amino acids directly stimulate insulin secretion, decreasing blood sugar 
and leading to the secretion of cortisol in reaction to the depression 
of blood glucose. The presence of lactose in milk, and of fat, to slow 
absorption of the amino acids, helps to minimize the secretion of cortisol. 
The main protein of milk, casein, seems to have some direct antistress 
effects (Biswas, et al., 2003).</font></p>

<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Since 
milk&#39;s primary biological function is to support the growth of a young 
animal, some of its features make it inappropriate as a sole food for 
an adult. To support cell division and growth, the methionine and tryptophan 
content of milk is higher than would be optimal for an adult animal, 
and the phosphate might be slightly more than needed, in relation to 
the calcium. Since the fetus stores a large amount of iron during gestation, 
the iron content of milk is low, and when a young animal has used the 
stored iron, its continuing growth requires more iron than milk provides. 
However, for an adult, the low iron content of milk and cheese makes 
these foods useful for preventing the iron overload that often contributes 
to the degenerative diseases.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Combining 
milk and cheese with fruits adds to the antistress effect. The additional 
sugar and potassium and other minerals allow the milk protein to be 
used more efficiently, by moderating the secretion of cortisol, and 
helping to inhibit the secretion of PTH.</font></p>
<p align="justify">   <font size="3" face="georgia,times,serif">Substances 
such as PTH, nitric oxide, serotonin, cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, 
thyroid stimulating hormone, and prolactin have regulatory and adaptive 
functions that are essential, but that ideally should act only intermittently, 
producing changes that are needed momentarily. When the environment 
is too stressful, or when nutrition isn&#39;t adequate, the organism may 
be unable to mobilize the opposing and complementary substances to stop 
their actions. In those situations, it can be therapeutic to use some 
of the nutrients as supplements. Calcium carbonate (eggshell or oyster 
shell, for example) and vitamins D and K, can sometimes produce quick 
antistress effects, alleviating insomnia, hypertension, edema, inflammations 
and allergies, etc., but the regular use of milk and cheese can prevent 
many chronic stress-related diseases.</font></p>
